Multi-Reference Editor Data Model
=================================

The data model for Multi-Reference Editor is based in Product-to-Product
references.

In this model example, there are two source objects (Design
Specification Variant and Sample) and one target object (Requirement).
Both source and target objects are products. The reference connecting
the objects is a Product Reference Type. An example of attributes valid
on the reference and the target objects listed below the reference /
object is pictured below.
