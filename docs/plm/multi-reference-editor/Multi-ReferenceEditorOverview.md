Multi-Reference Editor Overview
===============================

In the PLM data model, the majority of the data is on references and not
on objects. The users work on creating one reference at a time, adding
metadata, then running validations on the added data. The \'PLM Edit
Reference Action\' allows users to configure metadata to append to the
dialog menu, limiting what values on an object\'s references can be
changed.

In the private label food solution, the Multi-Reference Editor component
in Web UI supplies two specific functionalities for the PLM food
solution.

-   PLM Create References Action
-   PLM Edit Reference Action
