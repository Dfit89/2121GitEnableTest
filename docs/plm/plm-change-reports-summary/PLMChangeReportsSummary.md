PLM Change Reports Summary
==========================

On new product development, one of the more important functionalities is
to improve collaboration between different user roles who are involved
with bringing new products to market and with suppliers who are
responding to the requests to bid for supplying the new products.

During the collaboration process, product data can experience multiples
changes by different user roles. Each user group focuses on a specific
set of data at a specific state or phase of the process. In private
label food, there is a lot of collaboration back and forth between
different internal user roles as well as with several suppliers during
the process.

Clear visibility to changes in specifications and suppliers' responses
to them throughout the process is needed by all parties to ensure that
contractual agreements are well understood, and compliance standards are
met.

PLM private label food uses Change Reports to improve the data review
process.
