Laura, from the Supplier A team, is responsible for answering the Recipe
Response request received from the customer CIBUS. Laura accesses the

information for recipe ingredients, requirements, and parameters.

First, she enters the recipe ingredients, and for each ingredient added,
she fills out the ingredients quantity, country of origin, and whether
the ingredient is organic or not.
