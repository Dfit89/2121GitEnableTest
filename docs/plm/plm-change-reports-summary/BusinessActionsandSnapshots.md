Business Actions and Snapshots
==============================

In PLM Private Label Solution Food, business rules are created and
configured to determinate when the snapshot should take place. These
business rules for snapshots can be applied to workflow transitions or
any other event that supports executing business rules.

In PLM Private Label Food solution, the PLM Food Supplier Snapshot
business action is in use on the Initiate state of the Private Supplier
Response workflow. When a Supplier Response (Recipe Response, Label
Response, Packaging Response) is initiated in the workflow, a Snapshot
will be created.

Customers are responsible for creating business rules since each
customer has different needs

For more information on Snapshot business rules, see the **Business
Rules and Snapshots** topic in the **Change Reports** segment of the
**PLM for Admins** section of the **Product Lifecycle Management**
documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
