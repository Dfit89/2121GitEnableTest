Supplier Records Overview
=========================

When suppliers respond to a bid to supply a new private label product,
they enter information about requirements, parameters, ingredients, and
specifications. This information becomes a contract between the customer
and the supplier. The supplier needs their own record of what was
entered as part of their bid.

When a supplier submits their bid for either a recipe, packaging, or
label deal, the supplier receives an email with a record of what was
submitted. An asset with the submitted record is created and linked to
the submitted bid. If a supplier desires, it is possible in Web UI to
include a list of submitted bid records and also include the ability to
print the records.
