otherwise an empty HTML document is returned.

-   PLM Sample
-   PLM Packaging Variant Sample
-   PLM Label Variant Sample

**Argument 2**: Indicates if the generated HTML is to be emailed or not.
If the HTML is to be emailed (true) then the print link is not included.
If the HTMLÂ is not emailed (false) then the print link is included in
the generated HTML.

**Argument 3**: STEP Manager
