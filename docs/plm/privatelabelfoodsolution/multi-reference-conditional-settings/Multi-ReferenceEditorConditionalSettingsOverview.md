Multi-Reference Editor Conditional Settings Overview
====================================================

The private label food solution uses a Multi-Reference Editor to improve
the data review process.

In the PLM data model, most of the data is maintained on references, and
a user works on creating one reference at the time. The user then adds
metadata to the references and runs validations on the added data.

Suppliers are able to improve the completeness of their responses on a
Multi-Reference Editor to specific information based on a conditional or
conditionally mandatory attribute or flex attribute. With the more
improved response, communication loops between the Product Developers
and the suppliers are significantly reduced.

The following solution enablement documentation outlines how to use the
conditional settings on the Multi-Reference Editor to improve supplier
response efficiency.
