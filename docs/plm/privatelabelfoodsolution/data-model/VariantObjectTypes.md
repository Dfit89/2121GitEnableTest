Variant Object Types
====================

The following variant object types are required for the PLM private
label food solution data model to work.

DesignÂ Specification Composite Variant
--------------------------------------

A Design Specification Composite Variant represents a specification for
a product variation that requires more than one recipe, such as a box of
macaroni and cheese, which contains separate recipes for the macaroni
and the cheese sauce.

Design Specification Variant
----------------------------

A design specification variant (recipe specification) represents a
flavor variation for one or more new products. Details about
specifications, requirements, and parameters for each flavor variation
are collected on this object.

For example, the Macaroni and Cheese Project will have two flavor
variations:

-   Elbow Macaroni
-   Spirals Macaroni

For a recipe specification, some attributes or object types that might
be included are the following:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Recipe         | Specified      | Recipe         | Recipe         |
| Information    | Ingredients    | Requirements   | Parameters     |
+================+================+================+================+

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Design Specification Packaging Variant
--------------------------------------

A design specification packaging variant (packaging variant) represents
a package size variation for one or more new products. A packaging
variant description and requirements are collected on this object. In
the example below, the Macaroni & Cheese Project will be produced in one
package size: 7.25 oz.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Solution%20Enablement/PLM/DSPVariant.png)

For a packaging variant, some of the following attributes may apply:

+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Packaging Specification       | Packaging Requirements           |
+===============================+==================================+
| Packaging Name                | [Type]{style="font-size: 11pt;"} |
|                               |                                  |
| Packaging Variant Description | Requirement Description          |
|                               |                                  |
|                               | Help Text                        |
|                               |                                  |
|                               | Sort Order                       |
+-------------------------------+----------------------------------+

For each packaging specification, three \'Packaging Elements\' will be
created underneath the Packaging Elements node.

-   Consumer Packaging (Packaging Level 1)
-   Packaging Element (Packaging Level 2)
-   Packaging Tray (Packaging Level 3)

Design Specification Label Variant
----------------------------------

This represents a label variation for one or more new products. A label
variant represents a unique combination of one flavor variation, one
packaging variant, and one set of languages on the product label. It
represents the final item.
