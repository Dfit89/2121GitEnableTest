Sample Object Types
===================

The following sample object types are required for the PLM private label
food solution data model to work.

Composite Sample
----------------

Composite Sample represents a product variation that contains more than
one recipe. It is where suppliers see an overview of the product, the
recipes contained in the product and enter data that is relevant to the
product as a whole.

Sample
------

A Sample, also known as a Supplier Response, is an object that is
created for each supplier who should respond to recipe specifications.
This is where the supplier details the proposed recipe based on the
specification received from the customer.

Each supplier has one equivalent object per variant where they respond
to the specifications. All objects displayed underneath the Macaroni and
Cheese Project in the image below are used to handle Suppliers\'
recipes.

For a recipe response, some attributes that might be included are the
following:

| Recipe Requirements | Recipe Parameters   | Recipe Ingredients    |
+=====================+=====================+=======================+
| Meets Requirement?  | Meets Requirement?  | Ingredient            |
