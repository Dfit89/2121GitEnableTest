Design Specification
====================

A design specification represents the entire project and is a high-level
place to gather input for new products. A design specification could
represent multiple products. For food, it could represent multiple
packages sizes, flavors, and language(s) on the final product label. For
detailed specifications, variants are created for each option and
specified under the design specification.

Projects are organized in a one-level hierarchy.

For a project, some attributes that might be included are the following:
