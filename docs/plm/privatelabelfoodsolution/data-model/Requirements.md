Requirements
============

Requirements hold information about food standards to be met by the food
chain process. It ensures that the food is safe and is of good quality.
Requirements are also typically used to specify what the physical
characteristics of a food are such as: aroma, flavor, texture, color,
consistency.

Some examples of different types of requirements are Food Claim
Requirements, Label Requirements, and Quality Requirements

An example of a Quality Requirement would be:

**Best-before date**: for food for sale, this means the date up to which
the food for sale will remain fully marketable and will retain any
specific qualities that were expressed or implied.

It needs to remain in:

-   An intact package during its storage
-   Is stored in accordance with any storage conditions applicable under
    Standard 1.2.6

These requirements are just examples. Project teams should expect to
build these out and any detailing values.
