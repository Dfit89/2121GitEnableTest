PLM Private Label Food Implementation Guidelines
================================================

This guide introduces the PLM private label food solution available for
STEP 9.1 or later. It covers the necessary actions that an admin user
must take to set up the solution, as well as provide an overview of the
end user functionality.

The PLM private label food solution supports the recipe specification
process, ingredients validations, and supplier's responses. To support
these functionalities, new components have been developed. The new
components are available once the PLM license has been applied. For
additional questions about PLM licenses, contact your Stibo Systems
account manager.
