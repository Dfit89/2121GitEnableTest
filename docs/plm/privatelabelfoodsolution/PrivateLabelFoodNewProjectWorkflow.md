Private Label Food New Project Workflow
=======================================

PRODOC note: The tables in this topic are all images. This was a
conscious decision as it was just too much to put in the tables in
Flare, and with all of the merge cells, and the many tables needed it
was too much to put in manually. Additionally, the tables were not
playing nicely with one another and merging all the time.

This workflow captures information that is relevant for the overall
project on the Design Specification, which represents the overall
concept of the new product or group of products but not the details of
recipe, packaging, or labeling variations. The Design Specification
defines the type of product, the markets where the product should be
sold, commercial goals, and other fundamental aspects of the product.
Suppliers are also selected for the project and awarded the project at
the end. The overall progress of the Design Specification is tracked
through these states as a view to the overall progress of the project.
