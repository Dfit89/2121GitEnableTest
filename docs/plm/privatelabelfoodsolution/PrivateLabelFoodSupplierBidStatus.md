Private Label Food Supplier Bid Status
======================================

PRODOC note: The tables in this topic are all images. This was a
conscious decision as it was just too much to put in the tables in
Flare, and with all of the merge cells, and the many tables needed it
was too much to put in manually. Additionally, the tables were not
playing nicely with one another and merging all the time.

This workflow is used to provide suppliers a view of the status of their
open bids after the supplier has initially submitted the bid. Since the
supplier's samples are removed from the Supplier Response Workflow after
submitting a bid or responding to a request for a follow-up, this small
workflow will provide the supplier a dashboard and quick link to a list
of their responses that are still to be evaluated, or that are being
considered for the bid.

This workflow is not intended to allow suppliers to modify their bids,
only to view them.
