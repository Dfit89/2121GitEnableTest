Product MDM for Automotive
==========================

This portion of Solution Enablement material introduces the Product MDM
(PMDM) for Automotive functionality, including the use of Easy Setup and
other necessary configurations.

Click on a title in the left navigation panel to expand the topics under
it, or click the main topics below:

-   Automotive Quick Start Guide
-   Automotive Reference Guide
-   STEP Print for Automotive Guide
-   Release and Patch Notes for Product MDM for Automotive

It is recommended that users be well-versed in using STEP and the STEP
help topics before beginning advanced automotive functions.

However, if you are concerned only with the end user functionality
(working with automotive importers), as opposed to setting up and
configuring, you may wish to skip directly to the **Quick Start for
Users** section of this material[ here]{.mcFormatColor
