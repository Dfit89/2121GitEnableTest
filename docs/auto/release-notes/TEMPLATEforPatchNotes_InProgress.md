Patch recipe {#patch-recipe .MPNDownload}
------------

The Automotive add-on can be installed with the following recipe:

**xxxx**

The above recipe is compatible only with the STEP 8.2 baseline
(to:step/trailblazer/step-8.2.spr).

**PRODOC note: MEDU PRODOC- 1572** Once an Automotive add-on is
installed to a base STEP system, the base system cannot be upgraded
without upgrading the Automotive add-on at the same time. Additionally,
when upgrading any base STEP system that has any Automotive add-on
installed, both install recipes must be prepared at the same time.

For assistance in applying the patch to systems with extensions or
additional add-on components, contact Stibo Systems Technical Services.
