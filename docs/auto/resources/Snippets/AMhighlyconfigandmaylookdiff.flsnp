        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Application Manager is highly configurable via the Web UI Designer, and more than one Application Manager can be created within each Web UI (i.e., for each automotive standard). Therefore, it is expected that a Web UI administrator will configure an Application Manager in a manner that best meets their user's needs. Thus, your Application Manager may look different from what is described within this guide. For more information on configuring an Application Manager, see the <b>Configuring Application Manager</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Application Manager/Configuring Application Manager/Configuring Application Manager.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. </p>
