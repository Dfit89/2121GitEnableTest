1. Create Easy Setup User
=========================

This setup action is not required, but is strongly recommended. The
solution includes functionality to auto-create all objects, references,
attributes, workflows, etc., required to support the solution. The user
executing the auto-create functions (described in subsequent steps) will
be recorded as the creator / editor of those objects in STEP. It is
therefore recommended that a new user be created for this purpose, so
that an accurate audit trail is in place.

The user must be created as a Super User without any privilege
restrictions. For example:

Additional information on managing users and privileges is available in
the **STEP Online Help**.

The admin user managing the initial setup of the system should log in
using this newly created user before carrying out the following actions.
