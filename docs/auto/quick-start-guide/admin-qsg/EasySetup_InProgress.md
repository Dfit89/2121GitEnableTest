Easy Setup Actions
==================

PRODOC note: MEDU Easy setup is commonly referenced in RN and the
Automotive Documentation. I think we need to explain what it is and how
to access.

The solution includes functionality to auto-create all objects,
references, attributes, workflows, etc., required to support the
solution.

The point of the Easy Setup Actions is not to provide a fully functional
system, that is the work of the implementation team, but rather to
automatically create many of the object types, import framework,
business conditions, workflows, attributes, reference types needed to
begin an implementation. Easy Setup is especially helpful when
implementing an automotive standard like AutoCare, NAPA, and/or TecDoc.
