Using Automotive Importers
==========================

The individual processing of each import is of course different, but the
way a user initiates and manages the imports is the same, and is
described in the subsequent sections.

For information on the supported versions, see the **Supported Versions
and Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

If part and application data are imported into STEP without using the
proper ID structures, then errors will occur. Prior to importing, review
the **ID Structures in Importers** topic within the **Automotive
Reference Guide**[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
