Accessing Automotive Exporters
==============================

The individual processing of each export is of course different, but the
way a user initiates and manages the exports is the same.

Each exporter can be accessed by using the workbench File \> Export menu
(as shown below).

Once the Export Manager dialog displays, then the format can be
selected.
