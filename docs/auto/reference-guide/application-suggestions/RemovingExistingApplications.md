Removing Existing Applications
==============================

PRODOC note: BOND PRODOC- 1817

Users can remove an existing application record for a selected part
within Web UI. When the Part Application Editor component is configured,
and an application record is selected within the Existing Applications
list, a **Delete** button
(![](../../Resources/Images/Competitor%20OE%20Number/51.png){.img_intext})
displays at the component toolbar. Clicking the **Delete** button
(![](../../Resources/Images/Competitor%20OE%20Number/51.png){.img_intext}) 
will delete the application record for the selected part, and therefore,
the application record will no longer display within the list.

In the example below, part \'VC36115\' is selected within the Web UI
Tree, and an \'Applications Suggestions\' tab is configured to display
results for \'Existing Applications.\' Within the results, two
application records are displayed. An application record \'VC36115 2013
Volvo V40 Cross Country\' is selected which activates and displays
**Delete**
(![](../../Resources/Images/Competitor%20OE%20Number/51.png){.img_intext})
button thereby allowing users to remove that application record from the
selected part.

Clicking the Delete
(![](../../Resources/Images/Competitor%20OE%20Number/51.png){.img_intext})
button at the component toolbar deletes the application record and the
application record no longer displays within the Existing Applications
grid (as shown below).

If an application record is removed from the Existing Applications list,
and it previously displayed within the Suggested Applications list, then
the deleted application record will display within the suggestions list.
However, if the removed application record was not previously displayed
within the suggestions list (i.e., manually added), then it will not
display within the suggestions list.
