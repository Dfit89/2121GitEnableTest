Modifying Import Framework
==========================

It is intended that the default workflows be modified to support
customer-specific needs. Both the Extension API and the business rule
plugins provided with the Automotive solution will assist in this.

There are many out of the box business rules that can be added for
advanced functionality in the importers. For more information, see the
**Automotive Business Rule Plugins** section ([here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}).

The Extension API provides access to all of the files generated as part
of the import workflows (e.g., via conversion and delta calculation, as
well as the original file submitted for import). Furthermore, it
provides the ability to add new plugins to the existing framework that
can then be run as part of any existing background process service, such
as the Import Flow Extension Service created expressly for this purpose.

To clarify, customers may add new states to any workflow, or new rules
to any existing state, where they access and manipulate the files
generated by the import framework. In either case, if significant
processing is needed, this should be done as a background process using
the \'Run background process action.\'

Within that action, the **ImportFlowExtensionService** should be
selected. Any extensions that have been created by the customer via the
Extension API will be available for selection in the Extension parameter
dropdown.

Additional information can be found in the Extension API Javadoc.
Systems with one or more Automotive licenses will have access to the
**com.stibo.importflow.domain.extension** package which includes
interfaces for extending the import framework.
