It is expected that anyone using and/or configuring the PIES Importer be
familiar with the **Importing Automotive Data** section
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}), as basic concepts for
working with an automotive importer are not covered in this section.

For more information about uploading files to an application server, see
the **File Loading** section of the **Automotive Quick Start Guide**
found within the **Solution Enablement** section of **STEP Online
Help**[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

For more information about using Workbench to monitor and process
imports, see the **Workflows** section of **STEP Online Help**[
