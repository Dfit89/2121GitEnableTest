Sample AutoCare ACES File Structure
===================================

PRODOC note: Details can be found at PRODOC-1244

The intention of this topic is to introduce the basic AutoCare ACES file
structure and the way the objects are built in the system when the ACES
file is imported into the system.

Currently, the Automotive solution supports import and export of three
versions of ACES files. Namely, ACES 3.0, ACES 3.2 and ACES 4.0. All
three versions are common in its structure with additional add-on
features amongst the later versions. For better understanding, ACES 3.2
is considered to be an example throughout this topic.

The ACES file shall include only plain text delimited by \'valid\' XML
tags (as defined below). A CR/LF (ASCII 13,10 decimal) should separate
lines and it is recommended that the text should use UTF-8 character
encoding. However, ISO-8859-1 is also accepted.

File Naming

It is a good practice that the external file name of the ACES file shall
include the company, a short catalog title, the delivery date
(yyyy-mm-dd), and the word \'**FULL**\' or \'**UPD**\', or \'**TEST**\'
in a sequence all separated by underlines and an \"xml\" extension.
Below is an example of how an ACES file can be named.

Zipped File Imports

When more than one file is imported simultaneously into the system or
when the ACES file contains a million records so you would want to
reduce the size of the file, users can use an archiving program (such as
WinZip, or Windows XP \'Compressed (zipped) Folders\') to compress the
files into a single ZIP archive. Again, it is a good practice to name
the archive as above but without the catalog title and with a \'.zip\'
extension.

When more than one ACES files are zipped, and the user drop the zip file
into the hotfolder, those ACES files will not get processed
simultaneously unless it is configured for the ACES import to be able to
run in parallel (the default is that only one file will be processed at
a time).

Delivering ACES Files

Sample File structure

Below is a sample ACES 3.2 file with two application records

``` {.PreIndent space="preserve"}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<ACES  version="3.2">
<Header>
    <Company>KRMA</Company>
    <SenderName>Kay Jensen</SenderName>
    <SenderPhone>6787978489</SenderPhone>
    <TransferDate>2018-04-21</TransferDate>
    <BrandAAIAID>DKGX</BrandAAIAID>
    <DocumentTitle>ACES FILE</DocumentTitle>
    <EffectiveDate>2018-04-21</EffectiveDate>
    <SubmissionType>FULL</SubmissionType >
    <MapperCompany>Maps R Us</MapperCompany>
    <MapperEmail>maps@maps.com</MapperEmail>
    <VcdbVersionDate>2018-04-20</VcdbVersionDate>
    <QdbVersionDate>2018-04-20</QdbVersionDate>
    <PcdbVersionDate>2018-04-20</PcdbVersionDate>
</Header>
    <App action="A" id="1">
        <BaseVehicle id="5289"/>
        <MfrBodyCode id="2765"/>
        <EngineBase id="1305"/>
        <Qty>1</Qty>
        <PartType id="5696"/>
        <MfrLabel>ChkEngSens</MfrLabel>
        <Part BrandAAIAID="DKGX">VC36009</Part>
    </App>
    <App action="A" id="2">
        <BaseVehicle id="5289"/>
        <BodyNumDoors id="5"/>
        <EngineBase id="1305"/>
        <Qty>2</Qty>
        <PartType id="5696"/>
        <MfrLabel>ChkEngSens</MfrLabel>
        <Part BrandAAIAID="DKGX">VC36112</Part>
    </App>
    <Footer>
        <RecordCount>2</RecordCount>
    </Footer>
</ACES>
```

The whole ACES file is divided into three required sections: Header,
Body, and Footer.

### Header

This constitutes the initial section of the file. This section includes
generic file information such as company details, sender details, mapper
details, version details of Vehicle, etc. Header information is present
within the \<Header\> tags.

The order of the tags within the header is defined by the XML schema. In
the Header section, the \<Company\>, \<SenderName\>, \<SenderPhone\>,
\<TransferDate\>, \<EffectiveDate\>, \<SubmissionType\>,
\<VcdbVersionDate\>, \<QdbVersionDate\>, \<PcdbVersionDate\> and
\<DocumentTitle\> tags are required to be populated and cannot be left
empty.

ACES file is imported in to the system in the following ways:

-   **FULL**: All applications are found in the file
-   **UPDATE**: Only the changes made to the file since the last
    delivery are present in the file

These details are entered within the \<SubmissionType\> tags in the
header section of the file.

The \'action\' attribute (available in the body of the file as explained
below) is used to indicate changes. All records in the initial FULL load
of a file should be coded with an \'A.\' If desired, after the initial
FULL load, updates can be sent instead of the entire file. When
delivering updates, only transmit applications that are new or have
changed in some way. Changes are accomplished with a pair of \'D\'
(delete) and \'A\' (add) records. The \'D\' application record should
match the existing application record in the system as originally
delivered. The corresponding \'A\' record should contain the information
as the user now want it stored.

For example, if the user originally delivered a year-range application,
and now, the user wants to change a single year of that range, then it
is acceptable to delete one year using the old information and add the
updated information for that year.

### Body

The Body section contains catalog data that should only include the
information necessary to unambiguously select the correct part (PIES
Item). Each application record will be surrounded with the \<App\> tags
and can contain some or all of the following details.

-   Application Record Number

-   Base Vehicle ID

-   Make

-   Model

-   Years

-   Submodel

-   Engine Base ID

-   Part number

-   Part Type (Numeric ID of the Part type)

-   Position

-   Part Quantity

-   Note

-   Action ('A' or 'D', \'A\' indicates to add the application record
    and \'D\' indicates to delete the application record).

-   Asset ID

-   Asset name

-   All other attributes / vehicle options that exist for any
    application record create and populate a unique column.

Of the above listed details, the following information is required for
each application:

-   Base Vehicle ID

-   Part Type

-   Part Number

-   Part Quantity

A sample ACES XML body structure and the details in how it is populated
on the STEP system is displayed below

``` {.PreIndent space="preserve"}
     <App action="A" id="2">
        <BaseVehicle id="5289"/>
        <BodyNumDoors id="5"/>
        <EngineBase id="1305"/>
        <Qty>2</Qty>
        <PartType id="5696"/>
        <MfrLabel>ChkEngSens</MfrLabel>
        <Part BrandAAIAID="DKGX">VC36112</Part>
    </App>
```

App Action value \''A\''adds a new ACES application (if it was the value
'D' instead of \'A\' then it would notify the system to mark the
application for deletion).

The automotive importers do not delete any objects, it just marks
objects as new, delete, or change through change flags.

ID value \'2\' signifies the sequential order of parsing for the
applications.

The value in the \<part\> tag is extracted to identify the parent for
the application item. The application will be created / modified under
the 'VC36112' PIES Item. \<BodyNumDoors id=\"5\"/\>, \</MfrLabel\>, and
\<Qty\>, populates the respective attribute values as displayed in the
screenshot below.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_AC/12.png)

\<BaseVehicle id=\"5289\"/\> and \<EngineBase id=\"1305\"/\> creates a
reference to the objects within the Vehicle Configuration (VCdb)
classification and \<PartType id=\"5696\"/\> creates a reference to the
object within the Parts Categorization (PCdb) classification in the STEP
system as displayed in the screenshot below.

### Footer

The Footer section indicates the end of the data and provides a count of
the applications that is being transferred in the file.

``` {.PreIndent space="preserve"}
<Footer><RecordCount>2</RecordCount></Footer>
```

``` {.PreIndent space="preserve"}
Â 
```
