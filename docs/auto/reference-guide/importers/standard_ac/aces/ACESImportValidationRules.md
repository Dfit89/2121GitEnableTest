ACES Import Validation Rules
============================

When importing an AutoCare ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard)
file, many STEP validation rules are performed. The table below
describes each of these validation rules, where the validation check
occurs, what happens when a validation fails, and an example of a failed
validation message (when applicable). However, it does not detail the
file type\'s data rules per the AutoCare Association. This information
can be found at
[www.autocare.org](http://www.autocare.org/Default.aspx?gmssopc=1).
PRODOC note: 10/30/17 Link is live intentionally.

For information on the supported versions, see the **Supported Versions
and Formats** topic within this guide[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

For best results, AutoCare imports should be executed in the order
specified within the **AutoCare Import Validation Rules** topic[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

**Accepted File Extension:** .xml and .ZIP

  Text in number conditions                Conversion state                      BGP ends in an error, triggering the import to enter the Error state, and an exception to display within the conversion report.   Â 

PRODOC note: All Failed Validation Messages except \"Text in number
conditions\" provided by BEJA via RDCUST-2384

The ACES importer does not validate that the VCdb, PCdb, and/or Qdb
versions within STEP are the same versions within the ACES file.
