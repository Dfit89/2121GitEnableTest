It is expected that anyone configuring the PCdb Importer screen is
familiar with the Web UI Designer, as basic concepts for working with
the designer are not covered in this section. In addition, the user must
have appropriate privileges to access the designer. For more
information, see the **Designer Access** topic of the **Web UI Getting
Started / Web UI Setup and User Guide** documentation[

documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

### Prerequisites

Endpoint' needs to be configured in workbench. For information on

configured and is placed on the Homepage. For more information on
configuring the file loading widget, please refer to the **File Loading
Widget** topic in the **Web User Interfaces / Web UI Setup and User
Guide** documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
