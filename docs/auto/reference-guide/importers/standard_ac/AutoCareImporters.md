AutoCare Importers
==================

PMDM for Automotive offers an out-of-the-box solution for importing the
file types necessary to the AutoCare standard. Each of the AutoCare file
types has their own importer, and more information for each can be found
within their respective sections below.

When importing AutoCare data into STEP, it is important to understand
the different STEP validation rules.

Imports should be executed in the given order for best results, as there
are some dependencies between the imports.

1.  Qdb (Qualifier Database) ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
2.  Brand Table ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
3.  PCdb (Product Classification Database) ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
4.  PAdb (Product Attribute Database) ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
5.  VCdb (Vehicle Configuration Database) ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
6.  PIES (Product Information Exchange Standard) ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
7.  ACES (Aftermarket Catalog Exchange Standard)
