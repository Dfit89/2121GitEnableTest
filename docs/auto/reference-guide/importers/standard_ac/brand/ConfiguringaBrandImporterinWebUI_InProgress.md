Configuring a Brand Importer in Web UI
======================================

It is expected that anyone configuring the Brand Importer screen is
familiar with the Web UI Designer, as basic concepts for working with
the designer are not covered in this section. In addition, the user must
have appropriate privileges to access the designer. For more
information, see the **Designer Access** topic in the **Web UI Getting
Started** section of the **Web User Interfaces / Web UI Setup and User
Guide** documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

### Prerequisites

Prior to configuring a PAdb Importer, an IIEP 'AutoCare Brand Inbound
Endpoint' needs to be configured. For information on configuring
AutoCare PAdb Inbound Endpoint see the XXXXXX section (here) within the
XXXX guide.

Additionally, it is assumed that the file loading widget is already
configured and is placed on the Homepage. For more information on
configuring the file loading widget, please refer to the **File Loading
Widget** topic in the **Web User Interfaces / Web UI Setup and User
Guide** documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
