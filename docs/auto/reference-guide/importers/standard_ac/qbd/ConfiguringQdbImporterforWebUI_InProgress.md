Configuring Qdb Importer for Web UI
===================================

It is expected that anyone configuring the Qdb Importer screen is
familiar with the Web UI Designer, as basic concepts for working with
the designer are not covered in this section. In addition, the user must
have appropriate privileges to access the designer. For more
information, see the **Web UI Getting Started** section of the **Web
User Interfaces / Web UI Setup and User Guide** documentation[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

Details on how to add a widget to a homepage can be found in the
**Adding Widgets to a Homepage** topic in the **Getting Started**
documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

### Prerequisites

1.  Prior to configuring the Qdb Importer, an IIEP 'AutoCare Qdb Inbound
    Endpoint' needs to be configured. For information on configuring
    AutoCare Qdb Inbound Endpoint see the XXXXXX section (here) within
    the XXXX guide.
2.  It is considered that the file loading widget is already configured
    and is placed on the Homepage. For detailed procedures on
    configuring the file loading widget refer to the **File Loading
    Widget** topic located in the **Web User Interface / Web UI Setup
    and User Guide** documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}.
