AutoCare PAdb Importer
======================

PRODOC note: Details can be found at PRODOC-1244

The intention of the Automotive AutoCare PAdb Importer is to provide an
out-of-the-box solution for importing data included within a supported
PAdb file format. Because only supported versions will successfully
upload, before attempting to upload an AutoCare PAdb file, confirm the
file version being uploaded is listed within the **Supported Versions
and Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

This section includes information on:

-   Using AutoCare PAdb Importer[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Configuring AutoCare PAdb Importer[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}

Prerequisites

Prerequisites {#prerequisites conditions="Primary.Web"}
-------------

It is expected that anyone using and/or configuring the AutoCare PAdb
Importer be familiar with the **Importing Automotive Data** section
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}), as basic concepts for
working with an automotive importer are not covered in this section.
