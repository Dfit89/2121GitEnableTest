Rejected State
==============

When a file has been rejected by a user, the controller is moved to the
Rejected state. This indicates that the file has successfully completed
all pre-import processing, but has been deemed unacceptable for import
by a user, usually due to data issues. A rejected file cannot be
imported unless it is reloaded, so the only option to act on a
controller in this state is to discard it.

Clicking the **Reject** button will cause the Reject dialog (shown
below) to display at the top of the screen. A user must click the \'X\'
in the top right of the dialog to close it.
