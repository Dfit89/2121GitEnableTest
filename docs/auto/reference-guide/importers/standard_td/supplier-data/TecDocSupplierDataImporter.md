TecDoc Supplier Data Importer
=============================

PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST- Details can be found at PRODOC-1242

The intention of the Automotive TecDoc Supplier Data Importer is to
provide an out-of-the-box solution for importing data included within a
supported TecDoc Supplier Data file. Because only supported versions
will successfully upload, before attempting to upload a TecDoc Supplier
Data file, confirm the file version being uploaded is listed within the
**Supported Versions and Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

Only after a TecDoc Reference Data file has been successfully imported
into STEP, can TecDoc Supplier Data files *of the same version* be
imported into STEP. For more information, see the **TecDoc Reference
Data Importer** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

A Supplier Data file can be imported into STEP by uploading it to either
a configured hotfolder on an application server, or through a File
Loading Widget on a Web UI Homepage.

This section includes information on:

-   Using TecDoc Supplier Data Importer ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Configuring TecDoc Supplier Data Importer ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})

Prerequisites

Prerequisites {#prerequisites conditions="Primary.Web"}
-------------

It is expected that anyone using and/or configuring the TecDoc Supplier
Data Importer be familiar with the **Importing Automotive Data**
section[here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"
conditions="Primary.Web"}, as basic concepts for working with an
automotive importer are not covered in this section.

To successfully import a TecDoc Supplier data import file, the file
version must match the version of the last successfully imported
Reference Data file.
