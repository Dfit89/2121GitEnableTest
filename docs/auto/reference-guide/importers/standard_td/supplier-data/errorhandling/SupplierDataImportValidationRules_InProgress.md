Supplier Data Import Validation Rules
=====================================

When importing a TecDoc Supplier Data file many STEP validation rules
are performed. The table below describes each of these validation rules,
where the validation check occurs, what happens when a validation fails,
and an example of a failed validation message (when applicable).
However, it does not detail the file type\'s data rules per TecAlliance.

**Accepted File Extension:** .zip
