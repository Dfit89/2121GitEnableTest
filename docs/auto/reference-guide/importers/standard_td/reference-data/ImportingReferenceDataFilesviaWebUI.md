Importing Reference Data Files via Web UI
=========================================

The intention of the Automotive TecDoc Reference Data Importer Web UI
setup included within this topic is to provide an out-of-the-box
solution for importing data included within a supported TecDoc Reference
file. Because only supported versions will successfully upload, before
attempting to upload a TecDoc Reference Data file, confirm the file
version being uploaded is listed within the **Supported Versions and
Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

A TecDoc Reference Data file includes information on vehicle data (i.e.,
cars, commercial vehicles, vans, motorcycles), vehicle engines, axles,
drivers\' cabs, generic articles (product classification), criteria
(attributes), and key table suggestions regarding search structures.

Prerequisites

Prerequisites {#prerequisites conditions="Primary.Web"}
-------------

To easily start and monitor a TecDoc Reference Data Import, recommended
practice is to use a Web UI Import Controller screen specific to the
TecDoc Reference Data Importer. When the Easy Setup actions for the
TecDoc standard are completed, the TecDoc Import Controller screen is
automatically created and configured for use. Additional information can
be found in the **Configuring TecDoc Reference Importer** topic[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

It is expected that anyone using and/or configuring the TecDoc Reference
Data Importer be familiar with the **Importing Automotive Data** section
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}), as basic concepts for
working with an automotive importer are not covered in this section.

If the Easy Setup actions for the TecDoc Component model have been
completed, then the functionality explained within this topic should be
available. Otherwise, configuration is necessary. For more information,
see the **TecDoc Reference Data Importer** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

PRODOC note: MEDU GPC- 379 Very good information about the
ImportFlowExtensionContext that allows admins to maniuplate the files
generated by the import framework.

Using the TecDoc Reference Data Importer in Web UI
--------------------------------------------------

1.  Access the TecDoc Web UI Homepage.
2.  Upload a valid TecDoc Reference Data file to the application server
    hotfolder (root/upload/hotfolders/TecDocReferenceInputFolder), using
    the \'Reference\' drop zone of the \'TECDOC IMPORTS\' File Loading
    Widget.

For more information, see the **File Loading Widget** topic within the
**Web User Interfaces** section of **STEP Online Help**[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

1.  Once the upload has started, users can view the progress of the
    upload using the Background Process Notification Component.

In the example below, the BGP Notification Panel is expanded and the
file, \'REFERENCE\_DATA\_0618.zip\' is 29% processed.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/2.png)

For more information on using the BGP Notification Component and side
panel, see the **Background Process Notification Component** topic
within the **Main Properties Overview** section of **STEP Online Help**[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

Once created, the Controller is initiated into the workflow associated
with the importer (TecDoc Reference Import). From there, the TecDoc
Reference Import workflow takes over processing of the file via a series
of states using business rules and background processes to carry out the
processing of the file. Each import has an associated workflow and all
proceed through the same states by default. However, it is intended that
customers will expand on the existing states and actions to add their
own validations, reporting, and additional processing as needed.

1.  If a Node Details screen has been configured, then when the IIEP
    creates the Controller Entity object, users can view the Controller
    and its important information by navigating within the Tree side
    panel to the Import Flow Root \> TecDoc Reference. Otherwise, if a
    user clicks on an Entity in the Tree side panel, an error will
    display indicating the configuration is invalid.

If an error message displays when selecting an Entity within a Web UI,
then the Node Details screen has not been configured. For information
about configuring the Node Details Screen, see the **Node Details
Screen** topic within the **Web User Interfaces** section of **STEP
Online Help**[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

In the example below, the Tree side panel is expanded, and the
\'REFERENCE\_DATA\_0618.zip\' Controller with ID \'Controller- 102441\'
is displayed below the \'TecDoc Reference\' Entity. When the Controller
is selected, many details can be viewed within the Node Details screen.

In the screenshot below, the \'Enable Tag Conversion\' parameter within
the Attribute Value Group Component is enabled.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/1.png)

-   **Name:** STEP Name of the Controller entity. This is generated from
    the uploaded file original name.
-   **Automotive Import Flow State BGP:** Attribute used to store the
    IDs of the background processes.
-   **Import Flow State Status:** Attribute used to store and display
    the status of each process (rather than the overall status).
-   **Import Flow Overall Status:** Attribute used to store and display
    the global status of the file (rather than the process specific
    status).

5.  As the file is uploaded, and the Entity Controller moves through the
    TecDoc Reference Import workflow, users can monitor the progress
    using the \'TECDOC REFERENCE IMPORT\' Status Selector Widget on the
    Web UI homepage and/or the left side panel.

In the example below, the Tree panel is expanded, and the **Triple user
button** is selected so that all items assigned to any user are
displayed. Notice that one file is in the \'Ready for Import\' state,
and four files in the \'Import Completed\' state, for a total of five
files.

For more information, see the **Moving Tasks Trough a Workflow in Web
UI** topic within **STEP Online Help**[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/3.png)

1.  Clicking on the **Ready for Import** state within the Status
    Selector homepage and/or the left side panel widget will navigate
    the user to the TecDoc Reference Data Import Controller Screen with
    only those Controllers in the \'Ready for Import\' state displayed.
2.  Clicking the Controller icon displays the Import Details below the
    Controller list.

In the example below, Controller \'REFERENCE\_DATA\_0618.zip\' (ID
\'Controller-102441\') with an overall status of \'Done creating delta
file\' is selected and the Import Details are displayed below the
Controller list.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/4.png)

1.  Optionally, before starting the import, clicking on the
    \'completedwitherrors\' Background Process Link will display the
    Background Process Details screen where users can view or download
    the details of the validation process.
2.  Click the **Reject** button to move the Controller to the Rejected
    state. For more information, see the **Rejected State** topic within
    the **Import Framework** section[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}.
3.  Click the **Start import** button, the Start import dialog (shown
    below) displays at the top of the screen, and the Controller is
    moved to the Import state of the workflow. For more information, see
    the **Import State** topic within the **Import Framework** section[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/10.png)

Importing a TecDoc Reference Data file can take several hours, but the
import progress can be monitored using the \'TECDOC REFERENCE IMPORT\'
Status Selector Widget on the Web UI homepage and/or the left side panel
or the Import Controller Screen, Import process Status column.

In the example below, the TecDoc Reference Data Import Controller Screen
displays the Overall Status and the Import process status as \'Importing
files\...\' Additionally, the Background Process Link column displays a
link to the Background Process Details screen as \'running.\'

![](../../../../Resources/Images/Importers/Standard_TD/Reference/11.png)

1.  Optionally, click the \'running\' Background Process Link (shown
    above) to view the details of the import process within the
    Background Process Details screen.

Once the import has completed, the Controller is automatically moved to
the Import Completed state. For more information, see the **Import
Completed State** topic within the **Import Framework** section[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

For more information about Reference Data import validation rules and
example error messages, see the **Reference Data Import Validation
Rules** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
