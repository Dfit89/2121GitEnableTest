TecDoc Reference Data Importer
==============================

PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST- Details can be found at PRODOC-1241

The intention of the Automotive TecDoc Reference Data Importer is to
provide an out-of-the-box solution for importing data included within a
supported TecDoc Reference Data file. Because only supported versions
will successfully upload, before attempting to upload a TecDoc Reference
Data file, confirm the file version being uploaded is listed within the
**Supported Versions and Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

This section includes information on:

-   Using TecDoc Reference Data Importer ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Configuring TecDoc Reference Data Importer ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})

Prerequisites

Prerequisites {#prerequisites conditions="Primary.Web"}
-------------

It is expected that anyone using and/or configuring the TecDoc Reference
Data Importer be familiar with the **Importing Automotive Data** section
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}), as basic concepts for
working with an automotive importer are not covered in this section.

TecDoc is the world's largest automotive product and fitment data
aggregator and is owned by the parts suppliers themselves. It was formed
in 1998 to create a uniform vehicle and product description standard to
allow over 500 suppliers to broadcast and share their product data with
their customers.
