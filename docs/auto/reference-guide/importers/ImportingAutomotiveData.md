Importing Automotive Data
=========================

PRODOC note: Per KRMA - We should list specifics of the importers.
General use and access is covered in the Quick Start guide, but we need
details on how they actually work, per importer. What extra validations
are in play (if any)? What is created by them? How are IDs constructed?
Etc. It may make sense to merge some of that in with the data models.
Just stuff to think about that sometimes it\'s not 100% clear what data
is going where with the importers and/or what the limitations are with
them - e.g., sometimes certain data or parts of a format are not
supported, and all of that should be documented somewhere.

The Automotive solution provides extensive import capabilities.
Information within this section applies to all of the automotive
standards.

Before importing automotive data, it is recommended that you have an
understanding of the following:

-   Import Framework ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
-   Default Workflow States and Functions ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Modifying Import Framework ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Displaying Import Modifications in Web UI ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   ID Structures in Importers ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Adding Reporting Extensions to Imports ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Validation Error Handling ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})

For general information on the way a user initiates and manages
automotive imports, see the **Using Automotive Importers** section
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) of the **Automotive Quick
Start Guide**.
