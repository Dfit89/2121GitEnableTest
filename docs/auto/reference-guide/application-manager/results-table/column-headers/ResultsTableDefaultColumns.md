Results Table Default Columns
=============================

As shown in the image below, by default, an Application Manager results
table uses a Node List component to display:

-   \'Vehicle\' column as configured with the **Application Set Assembly
    Component**.
-   \'Part Terminology\' column as configured with the **Application
    Part Type Title Header Component**.
-   \'Part Number\' column as configured with the **Application Set Part
    Component**.
-   \'Options\' column as configured with the Application Condition
    Header - Group Component found within the **Application Condition
    Header Components** topic ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}).
-   \'Notes\' column as configured with the **Application Comment
    Component**.
-   \'Qualifiers\' column (AutoCare solution only) as configured with
    the **ACES Application Qualifiers Component**.
-   \'Assets\' column as configured with the **Application Asset
    Reference Component**.

Each column label can be edited as needed by accessing the Application
Manager Node List Properties Child Component Headers parameter.

The example above is from an AutoCare Application Manager. However,
NAPAÂ and TecDoc Application Managers use the same results table
settings, but the AutoCare specific headers are removed.
