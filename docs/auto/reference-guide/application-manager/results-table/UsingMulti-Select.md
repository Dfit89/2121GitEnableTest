Using Multi-Select
==================

In the Application Manager results table, it is possible to multi-select
a set of records and edit them. If you use the consolidated options
header for editing, a value editor dialog will display all attributes
and references in the attribute group(s) identified in the header
configuration AND have data populated on any of the selected records or
have the attributes linked to one or more of the selected part types (in
the case of references, the \'linking\' is via the Reference Part Type
Links metadata attribute on the part type).

If the records you have selected already have values populated in the
displayed attributes / references, then the Value editor will display
the data values for the cell that is double clicked by the user. In
other words, if three records are selected and then the cell in the
middle is double clicked, those records are the data values that will
display.PRODOC note: RDCUST-2390
