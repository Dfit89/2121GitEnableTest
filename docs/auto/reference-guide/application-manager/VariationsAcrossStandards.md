Variations Across Standards
===========================

There are terminology variations within the Application Manager for each
standard, as well as minor variations in the available headers for the
results table.

For example:

-   AutoCare offers search results column headers labeled as Vehicle,
    Part Terminology, and Part.
-   AutoCare contains a Qualifiers header, whereas a TecDoc editor does
    not.
-   NAPA offers search results column headers labeled as Vehicle, MPCC,
    NAPA Product, Conditions, and Comments.
-   TecDoc offers search results column headers labeled as Assembly,
    Generic Article, and Article.

Despite these differences, the overall functionality is the same,
allowing users to search for applications, and view and edit application
data. The upper half of the screen provides the search functionality,
and the lower half of the screen displays the results and allows for
editing of application records (unless a read-only configuration is
applied).

Each implementation has the option to add and remove data to the results
display. Additionally, the vehicle options / criteria that are displayed
vary dynamically by the part types included in the results, based on
configuration options which are described below.
