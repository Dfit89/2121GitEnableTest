Workbench Configurations Related to Validation Path Functionality
=================================================================

The automotive validation path functionality is automatically configured
for the AutoCare standard through Easy Setup in the workbench. The
validation path functionality must be manually configured within the
workbench for the NAPA and TecDoc standards. Though configuration occurs
in the workbench, it is not intended that the workbench be used to
create, nor edit, part application data. Rather the Application Manager
has been designed specifically for this. Nonetheless, it can be helpful
to review the following workbench configurations related to automotive
validation path prior to using or configuring an Application Manager.

This section addresses the following workbench configurations related to
the automotive validation path functionality:
