Validation Path Functionality and Missing Applications
======================================================

The automotive validation path functionality aids in displaying missing
application coverage by evaluating all options and/or criteria for
existing applications and displaying only those options that are valid
for the vehicle configuration. In other words, consider when a vehicle
is available with two different engines, and a part is applied to engine
A, vehicles with engine B will display as a missing application.

When automotive validation path functionality is in place, and a part is
applicated for a vehicle, a missing application will display for each
condition related to the part in the search as a single row within both
the Application Manager results table, and the Application Coverage
Report.

More information on missing application coverage can be found within the
**Missing Application Coverage Functionality** topic
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) of this guide.
