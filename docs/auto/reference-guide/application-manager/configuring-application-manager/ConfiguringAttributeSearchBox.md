Configuring Attribute Search Box
================================

Panel are below.

1.  From the Vehicle Type Search Panel Properties dialog, click the
    **Add** button below the Search Box Types parameter field, and the
    Add Component dialog will display.

**Attributes:** This required field determines the attributes that
allows users to add one or more attribute value criteria to their
search. All attribute validation base types (e.g., Text, Number, List Of
Values) are allowed. Click the Add button to find and select the
required attributes. The selected attributes must be valid for the
object type that is defined in the Vehicle Object Types parameter, and
the attribute value must be populated on that object in order for it to
display correctly.

1.  Once the required parameters are populated, click the **Save**
    button to return to the Vehicle Type Search Panel Properties, and
    optionally add another search box type, or move on to the next
    required parameter.

Below is an example of a configured Attribute search box type for the
AutoCare standard.
