Application Manager
===================

Application Manager is an interactive and robust tool that combines the
power of an easy-to-use intelligent search interface with an effective
results table. This allows Web UI users to quickly and easily build
custom searches involving valid combinations of different vehicle types,
makes, models, years, options, regions, and part types. Once a broad (or
narrow) search criteria is selected, users can view, create, edit, and
delete part applications, along with many other aspects of the search
results. Additionally, users can easily create an Excel report for the
customized search criteria results by clicking the Report button.

When Easy Setup actions have been used to create a standard data model,
by default, much of the Application Manager is ready to be used, and for
ease of access a link to the Application Manager screen is added to the
Quick Links widget on the Web UI Homepage. In the example below, Easy
Setup has configured the AutoCare Application Manager and provided a
link within the Quick Links widget.

Prior to completing the Easy Setup actions, if links exist in the Quick
Links widget, then the Application Manager link will be added at the
very bottom of the list.

Until the Vehicle table classification is properly configured, the Quick
Links widget cannot be used to access the Application Manager screen
because when Easy Setup actions are used to configure an Application
Manager, the mandatory parameters within the Designer are populated with
Vehicle root nodes. Thus, if Vehicle tables have not been imported, and
the link to the Application Manager within the Quick Links widget is
clicked, the error shown below will display because the Vehicle root
does not exist.

The top half of the Application Manager screen offers features related
to the intelligent search interface. The bottom half of the screen is
dedicated to the search results table and its toolbar. Both halves of
the screen can benefit from the automotive validation path
functionality.

In the example above, an Application Manager is used to find existing
and missing spark plug applications for Toyotas manufactured in the
United States with the TRD Pro sub model option.

powerful features that can be configured within an Application Manager
