Using Year Search Box
=====================

PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2721The Year search box allows users to add one
or more year criteria to their search. This section addresses
functionality that is specific to the Year search box. For more
information on the general functionality found within the search boxes,
see the **Using Search Boxes** topic ([here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}) within this guide.

When the cursor is placed within the typeahead field for the Year search
box, and all other search boxes are blank, the dropdown will not display
until at least one number is typed into the typeahead field. However,
when one or more criteria are added to the Make/Model search box, and
then the cursor is placed within the Year field, a dropdown list will
display with only those years that pertain to the criteria within the
other synchronized search boxes. For example, when the Make/Model search
box is populated with the \'4Runner\' criterion, and the cursor is
placed within the typeahead field of the Year search box, then a list of
years from 1984-2018 displays. However, when the Sub Model search box is
populated with the \'TRD Pro\' criterion, and then the cursor is placed
within the typeahead field of the Year search box, then a list of years
from 2015-2018 displays (as shown below).

The Make/Model search box must be populated with at least one criterion
for the dropdown options for the Year and Options search boxes to
automatically display when the cursor is placed within the search box
field.

For more information about synchronized search boxes, see the **Search
Box Synchronization** topic within the **Using Intelligent Search
Interface** section ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) of
this guide.
