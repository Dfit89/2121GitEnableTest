Saved Search Tool
=================

Users can quickly populate previously saved search criteria by selecting
the name of a saved search from the saved search dropdown. Saved
searches can consist of many different combinations of intelligent
search interface selections, including criteria within one or more
search boxes, existing and/or missing application coverage selection,
and/or brand selection.

Once one or more search criteria selections are made, users can save the
selections with a custom name. Using previously saved searches can be
helpful when the same search criteria is needed repeatedly, or when
using a basic set of saved search criteria aids users in more quickly
building complex searches.

Saved searches are restricted by User login, Web UI, Vehicle Type Search
Panel, and Screen ID. In other words, users will only see the saved
searches created with their login for the specific Web UI being used.
Additionally, this allows users to create a succinct list of saved
searches that is relative to each Vehicle Type Search Panel.

The saved search tool does not save search results, but rather the
search box criteria, existing and/or missing application dropdown
selection, and/or brand selection. Once a saved search is selected from
the dropdown, the Search and/or Report buttons can be used to view the
search results.

The saved search tool is located at the bottom left of the intelligent
search interface (below the first search box), and consists of the
following:

1.  **Saved search dropdown:** Allows users to select the name of a
    previously saved search from an alphabetized list of saved search
    names.
2.  **Save icon:** Allows users to save the intelligent search interface
    selections (i.e., criteria within search boxes, existing or missing
    application coverage selection, brand selection) by either creating
    a new saved search or overwriting an existing saved search.
3.  **Rename icon:** Allows users to edit the name of the selected saved
    search.
4.  **Delete icon:** Allows users to delete the selected saved search.

Saving a Search
---------------

The Save icon is disabled until at least one criterion is added,
removed, or edited. The steps involved with saving search criteria are
different when a new saved search is being created, versus an existing
search being overwritten. This section will first address the steps
involved with creating a new saved search, and then overwriting an
existing saved search.

Creating a Saved Search

Once one or more criteria have been added to a search box, and the Save
icon is enabled, the following steps can be used to create a new saved
search.

1.  Click the Save icon, and the \'Save search\' dialog will display as
    shown below.

![](../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved%20Search%20Criteria/1.png)

As long as a saved search has not been selected (thus the saved search
dropdown is blank), then the Save search dialog will display as shown
above.

1.  Within the Name parameter, type a name that best describes the saved
    search. The name can be created using any alphanumeric combination,
    but should be easy to identify for future use in the saved search
    dropdown.
2.  Once at least one character is entered into the Name parameter, the
    OK button is enabled. Click the OK button to finish creating the
    saved search. The Save search dialog will close and the newly
    created saved search will display in the saved search dropdown.

Overwriting an Existing Search

When a saved search is selected in the dropdown, one or more criteria
have been added or removed from a search box, and the Save icon is
enabled, the following steps can be used to overwrite a saved search.

1.  Click the Save icon, and the \'Save search\' dialog will display as
    shown below.

![](../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved%20Search%20Criteria/Overwrite.png)

As long as a saved search has been selected (thus the saved search
dropdown is populated), then the Save search dialog will display as
shown above.

**Overwrite existing search:** By default, the \'Overwrite existing
search\' option is selected. Choosing this option will overwrite the
currently selected saved search with the newly edited criteria.

**Save as new search:** Selecting the \'Save as new search\' option will
enable the Name parameter. By default, the Name parameter is populated
with the currently selected saved search name appended with \'(1).\'
Populate the Name parameter in a way that is easy to identify for future
use in the saved search dropdown.

1.  Once the desired option is selected and/or populated, click the
    OKÂ button. The Save search dialog will close and the newly created
    saved search will display in the saved search dropdown.

Renaming a Saved Search
-----------------------

Once a previously saved search name is selected from the dropdown and
the Rename icon is enabled, the following steps can be used to edit the
name of a saved search.

1.  Click the Rename icon, and the Rename Search dialog will display the
    Name parameter populated with the current name of the saved search.
    In the example below, the Acura Applications Saved search was used.

1.  Populate the Name parameter in a way that is easy to identify for
    future use in the saved search dropdown.
2.  Once the desired Name is populated, click the OK button to save the
    change.

Deleting a Saved Search
-----------------------

Once a previously saved search name is selected from the dropdown, and
the Delete icon is enabled, the following steps can be used to delete
the saved search.

Once the saved search is deleted, it will no longer display for
selection in the dropdown, and cannot be recovered.

1.  Click the Delete icon, and the Delete dialog will display confirming
    the Name of the saved search to be deleted (as shown below).

1.  Click the OK button, the dialog will close, and the saved search
    will no longer display in the dropdown list.
