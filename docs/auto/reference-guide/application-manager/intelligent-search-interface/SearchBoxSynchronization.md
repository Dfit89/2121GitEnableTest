Search Box Synchronization
==========================

PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2673 Because the Make/Model, Year, and Options
Group Search Boxes are synchronized, search criteria can be entered into
any one of the search boxes in any order, and the available search
criteria will display in the dropdown based upon the criteria entered
within the other search boxes. For example, when \'Tahoe\' is selected
for the Make/Model search box, \'Z71\' is selected for the Sub Model
search box, and the cursor is placed within the Year search box field,
then the years displayed within the typeahead are only those that the
Chevy Tahoe with the Z71 option were manufactured.

PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2726 To remove criteria that is displayed
within a search box, click the \'X\' to the right of the value, or use
the Clear All link to clear all criteria within all search boxes.
