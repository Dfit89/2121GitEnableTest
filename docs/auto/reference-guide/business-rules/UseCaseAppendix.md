Use Case Appendix
=================

The following use cases address various circumstances where the Business
Action operation \'Set import status attributes\' can be applied when
using the PMDM for Automotive solution.

-   Use Cases - Tracking Newly Created Objects[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Use Cases - Tracking Deleted Objects[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Use Cases - Tracking Changed Objects[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Use Cases - Clearing Delete Status Flag[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}

It is important to note that the delete status flag (an attribute
defined to indicate the delete status) is configured in the Delta
Calculation state, so the user should have detailed knowledge about the
Delta Calculation state. For more information, see topics **5. Update
Delete Status Attribute and Delta Calculation Method in Import
Workflows** ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) and **Delta
Calculation State** ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) within
the **Automotive Reference Guide**.
