Configuring the Copy Applications to Related Parts Business Action in Web UI
============================================================================

Once the business action has been configured in the workbench,
configuration within Web UI is necessary. This section addresses the
steps necessary within Web UI.

After the initial setup, the access to the dialogs does not change,
therefore these steps can be helpful when editing the configuration.
However, when editing the \'Add\' button will be replaced with the
\'Save\' button, and the \'Add component..\' labels at the top of the
dialogs will display as \'Edit component\... .\'

1.  Access the Application Manager screen where the business action
    needs to be available to users.
2.  Access the Designer \> navigate to Node List Properties \> Child
    Components \> Actions \> Double click **Bulk Applications Updates**
    and the \'Bulk Applications Updates Properties\' dialog will display
    (as shown below).

    Applications Update Properties\' dialog will display (as shown
    below).
