Using Search by Cards Screen withÂ Data Onboarding Tasks
=======================================================

While the Search by Card Screen is designed to perform a search based on
the valid combinations of Name, parent hierarchy, and attribute values,
one use case for this Search by Card Screen in Onboarding task is to
display the searched result object on Onboarding Comparison Screen by
using Forward Screen Action button.

This topic describes how to navigate an object displayed in the search
result table onto Onboarding Comparison Screen that is used in the
Onboarding tasks.

Prerequisites
-------------

This topic assumes the following:

-   An understanding of how to configure the Forward Screen Action
    button as a toolbar component in the Search by Cards Screen. For
    more information, see the **Forward Screen Action Component** topic
    within the **Onboarding Comparison Screen** section of this guide[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
-   An understanding of how to perform a search in the Search by Cards
    Screen. See the **Using Search by Card Screen Interface** topic
    ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) for more information.

Navigating to the Onboarding Comparison Screen
----------------------------------------------

When accessing the Onboarding Comparison Screen via a Forward Screen
Action button, the default screen behavior varies depending on whether
or not the Target object exists. Also, the presence of multiple Target
objects for the selected Source object does not allow to display the
Onboarding Comparison Screen. If there exists no Target object, or if
there exists multiple Target objects for the selected Source object,
then the following error message will be displayed on the screen.
