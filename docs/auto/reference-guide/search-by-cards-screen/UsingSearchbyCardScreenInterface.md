Using Search by Card Screen Interface
=====================================

The Search by Card Screen intelligent search interface has been
carefully designed to allow users to quickly and easily select criteria
for valid combinations of Name, parent hierarchy, and attribute values.
This allows users to create accurate search criteria on the fly and
benefit from the customized search results. This is accomplished by
allowing users to select only valid criteria across multiple search
cards per the configuration of the Search by Card Screen.

Each Search by Card Screen can be configured to display up to five
search cards. Of the available options, Name Search Box and Hierarchy
Search Box components can be added only once and Attribute Search Box
can be added multiple times. Within each search card, a typeahead field
is used to view and select valid search criteria. Because only valid
criteria can be selected within each typeahead field, the Search by Card
Screen provides automated intelligence for each search. Thanks to the
synchronization of the search cards, the valid criteria is considered
upon each selection and within any of the displayed search cards, no
matter the order of entry.

For example, if the Hierarchy search card contains a Base Vehicle that
was only produced from 2011-2018, then the typeahead field within the
attribute search card (configured to display VCdb Year attribute) will
only allow to enter those years for selection (notice that the initial
characters of the attribute value have to be typed in the type ahead
field). Because Audi (Make) has A1 (Model) beginning with the 2011 model
year, the available years are displayed as 2011-2018 when 'A1' is
selected within the Hierarchy search card (as shown below).

However, if an additional Model (A3 ) is added to the Hierarchy search
card, then the available years display as 2010-2019 (notice that the
initial characters that are typed in the typeahead field are \'201\').
