Using Name Search Card
======================

The Name search card allows users to add a name criteria to their
search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the
Name search card. For more information on the general functionality
found within the search cards, see the **Using Search Cards** topic
([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) located in this
documentation.

Within the Name search card, the typeahead field can be used to search
for the name of the object that is intended for search, and the use of
an asterisk will allow for a wildcard search. Only Names are searched,
not IDs. The dropdown list displays criteria options alphabetically. For
example, if \'\*Acu\' is typed into the field, then the dropdown list
displays the object name (of the object type that is defined in the
design mode) containing \'Acu\' alphabetically (as shown below).
