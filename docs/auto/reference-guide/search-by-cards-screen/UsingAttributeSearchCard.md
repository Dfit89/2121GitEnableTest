Using Attribute Search Card
===========================

The Attribute search card allows users to add one or more attribute
criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is
specific to the Attribute search card. For more information on the
general functionality found within the search cards, see the **Using
Search Cards** topic ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
within this guide.

When the cursor is placed within the typeahead field for the Attribute
search card, and all other search cards are blank, the dropdown will not
display until at least the initial characters are typed into the
typeahead field. The minimum character(s) requirement for typeahead is
configured in design mode. For more on configuration, see the
**Configuring the Attribute Search Box** topic within this guide[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

When multiple attributes are defined to be in the search criteria within
the same Attribute search card, a dropdown will be displayed next to the
title of the search card that allows users to select the required
attribute search criteria (as shown below).
