Configuring Web UI for Data Onboarding Solution
===============================================

This topic covers how to configure the Web UI for Onboarding /
Outboarding data in Web UI.

Prerequisites
-------------

Designers need to create and configure an Onboarding Mappings Details
Screen, to configure left stack panel as an access to Mapper
Configurations, and to configure different Mapper Configurations to meet
user requirements. Detailed configuration and usage instructions are
provided in the following topics of this documentation:

-   Onboarding Mappings Details Screen[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Configuring Mapper Configuration Setup Entity[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   Using an Onboarding Mappings Details Screen[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}

Onboarding Mappings Details Screen
----------------------------------

The Onboarding Mappings Details screen is used to set up Mapper
Configurations in Web UI. User can further configure the Mapper
Configurations within this screen to configure Mapping plugins. For more
information, see **Using an Onboarding Mappings Details Screen** topic[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

Mapper Configurations - Stack Panel Component
---------------------------------------------

The left Stack Panel should be configured as an entry point to display
the list of available Mapper Configurations wherein the display and
further configuration of these available Mapper Configurations is done
using Onboarding Mappings Details screen.

Multiple Mapper Configurations can be created under this stack panel
component to meet different data onboarding needs. As an example, there
may be multiple requirements to onboard or offboard different objects,
attributes, etc. In such cases, the creation of multiple Mapper
Configurations is required to meet different needs. All the available
Mapper Configurations are listed in the left Stack Panel component. For
more information, see **Onboarding Mappings Details Screen** topic[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
