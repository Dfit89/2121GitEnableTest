Mapping Plugins
===============

Within each Mapper Configuration, mapping plugins are added to define
what data needs to be retrieved and moved between the Source and the
Target object. The settings available in these plugins allow more
control over the behavior of the Mapper Configuration. The plugin suite
for automotive data mapping consists of the following four plugins:

-   Application Mapping Plugin ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Attribute Mapping Plugin ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Business Action Mapping Plugin ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Object to Object Mapping Plugin ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})

Details on how to configure and use these plugins are provided in their
respective topics below. For more information about how to add these
plugins, see the **Using the Onboarding Mappings Details Screen** topic[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
