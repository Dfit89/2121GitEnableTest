Initial Setup for Product Content Management Module
===================================================

licenses must be enabled. Contact your account manager to enable
licenses for your system.

-   X.App.ProductVariants
-   X.Smartsheet

Contact your StiboÂ Systems account manager or partner manager for
information on installing PMDM for Retail using configuration files.

Prerequisites and Considerations
--------------------------------

The following prerequisites and considerations apply to using the
Product Content Management business module:

-   The Product Content Management business module deals with sell-side
    products only.
-   Users must be granted the \'Install Business Modules\' setup action
    to install business modules.
-   The module should only be installed on clean systems. If data
    structures already exist in the target system (e.g., product or
    classification hierarchy), or standard STEP base objects have been
    removed, it is not guaranteed that the module can be successfully
    installed.
-   If any of the steps within a business module fail during
    installation, the installation may not fully complete, though as
    much data will be imported as possible.
-   The minimum required baseline for the module is version 9.2-mp3.
