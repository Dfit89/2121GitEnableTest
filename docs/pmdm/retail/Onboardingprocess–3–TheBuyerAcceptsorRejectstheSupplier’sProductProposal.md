When a new External Source Record has been created in PMDM for Retail
and initiated in the External Source Record Handling workflow, the
workflow checks if the specific Supplier is configured to allow for
automatic approval of proposed products or if it has to go through a
manual process where the Buyer has to manually decide if we want to
onboard the product.

On the homepage, in the "External Record Handling" widget, the buyer
will see the number of External Source Records concerned.

In the manual proposal approval process the buyer has the option to
approve the product data and continue with the onboarding of the
product, send it back to the Supplier for rework in case the supplied
data is wrong or incomplete or reject the product for onboarding in case
the Retailer do not want to onboarding and sell the product.

On the Product Page, the Buyer will make his choice:
