Product MDM Modules
===================

The following modules are available in PMDM for Retail:

-   **Product Content Management** is a 1:1 product data flow where the
    purchased product is exactly the same as the sold product. There are
    no separate objects and no supplier data onboarding.
-   **Vendor Data Management** is an n:1 product data flow where there
    can be multiple supplier-side products for one retailer-side product
    (buy-side / sell-side).
