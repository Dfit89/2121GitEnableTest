Using PDS, the vendor will onboard and submit their product information
to the Retailer. The following is a typical process followed by the
vendor.

-   **Import Data**: Vendors can upload product data and assets either
    from Excel or using PDS' APIs to integrate with their internal
    systems.

-   **Master Data**: Vendors can view, and when required, manage
    imported product data and digital assets.

-   **Categorization**: Vendors will manually select or create
    automation rules to map products to retailer categories.

-   **Mapping and Validation**: To ensure they meet the Retailer's
    requirements, the vendor will map their master data attributes to
    the retailer specific attributes, viewing any error messages, and
    using attribute value transformations or data edits to resolve
    errors.

-   **Process Management**: From product onboarding and maintenance to
    viewing and responding to reject and return reasons, vendors can use
    PDS to manage the end-to-end process of syndicating their product
    information to the retailer.
