PMDM for Retail Key Concepts
============================

PMDM for Retail is a solution that manages product data across your
company. But who creates, enriches, and classifies this product data?
Even if the answer varies for each organization, the following standard
actors are typically involved in Master Data Management.

PRODOC note: JOPI - using p.Body1 instead of p.Image1 for these to
eliminate the extra space AFTER the images.

                                                                          User                Role
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  ![](../../../Resources/Images/PMDM%20for%20Retail/retailer.png)         Retailer            Buys products from suppliers and sells them to customers.
  ![](../../../Resources/Images/PMDM%20for%20Retail/supplierVendor.png)   Supplier / Vendor   Sells products to retailers.
  ![](../../../Resources/Images/PMDM%20for%20Retail/dataProvider.png)     Data Provider       Produces product data as a service.
  ![](../../../Resources/Images/PMDM%20for%20Retail/customer.png)         Customer            Buys products from the retailer.

The retail\'s actors are discussed below.

Retailer\'s Actors
------------------

From the retailer\'s perspective, the following tables show the users
and roles involved in the PMDM for Retail solution.

Some actors are valid for both modules (PCM and VDO), while some are
specific to VDO only.

Technically, MDM also involves machine-to-machine (M2M), where exchange
and automation happen between the systems. This means the external
systems must also be considered as actors.

eliminate the extra space AFTER the images.
