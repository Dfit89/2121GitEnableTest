Data Modeling Attributes
========================

The following section details what attributes are used to create the
data model.

Attribute Groups
----------------

Attributes should be organized into domain specific attribute groups.
Typically, these domains include:

-   Entity Type: **Address Data Containers**; Domain Folder: **Address
    Data**

countries whose reference data does contain a PO box.

Data container types should be created under the domain with which they
are used.

These attributes can be used across different object types, like where
Individual and Organizational Customer records, as well as Contact data
on Individual Customer, Organization Customer, and Contact Person
records.

In accordance with the general guidelines for organizing attributes in
attribute groups, separate attribute groups should also be created for:

-   Displaying in Web UI, to ease Web UI component setup.
-   Each survivorship rule, to provide a clear definition of
    survivorship rules.
-   Each data quality policy, to provide a clear overview of which
    attributes are part of each data quality metric.
-   Each Object Type for each export definition, to provide a clear
    definition of what is exported to where.
-   In accordance to the guidelines around privilege configuration.
-   Each Object Type, to describe what is included in data profiling, to
    ease the profiling configuration.
