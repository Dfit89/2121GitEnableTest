Other Object Types
==================

Domain Folder constraints are less important than hierarchy constraints,
as it typically does not require a user to select a folder. Due to this,
it is recommended to limit complexity of Domain Folder Object Types. To
preserve a basic integrity of data, it is recommended to create separate
Object Types per data domain.

ID Patterns
-----------

Use auto-generated STEP IDs for Entities and Data Containers managed by
STEP. For information on auto IDs, see the **Autogenerate Using Name
Pattern and ID Pattern** topic of the **System Setup / Super User
Guide** documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
