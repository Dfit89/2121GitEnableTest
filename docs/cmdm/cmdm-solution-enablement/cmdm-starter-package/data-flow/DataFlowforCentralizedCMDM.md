Data Flow for Centralized CMDM in B2B Solutions
===============================================

In a centralized implementation methodology, origination and stewardship
/ maintenance of customer records reside within CMDM. While many
different types of data are often associated with customer records, it
is important to note that the role of CMDM is to capture the customer
master data that drives operational processes within an organization.
Within this release, we will focus primarily on centralized methodology
for Business-to-Business (B2B) organizations within the Consumer
Packaged Goods (CPG) industry.

CPG companies manage a wide array of products, brands, categories, and
channels, while serving diverse customer segments across multiple
geographic regions worldwide. Their end consumers of products are either
individual consumers or other businesses such as hospitals, schools,
restaurants, etc. 

In CPG companies, the majority of revenue is generated by selling
through a network of retail chains, distributors, and master
wholesalers. These parties are who the CPG company considers its
customers.  Any CPG company has the following operational functions as
part of the sales side of their business:

-   Sales
-   Distribution
-     Accounting and finance

To meet the needs of such operational functions, CMDM is implemented to
enforce and guide the organization in onboarding customers by providing
a means to enrich, govern, and maintain their customer data in a
centralized manner.

Initiate B2B Customer Record
----------------------------

A new customer record request is initiated within MDM through the Web UI
interface. Initial data provided is the legal name of the business
entity being onboarded. At this point, two options are provided in the
Web UI:

-   Find Similar -- to ensure no other record with a similar legal name
    already exists, the user is presented with matching candidates if
    any are found.
-   Save -- If no matching candidate is found, the user may save as a
    new record.

For details on Find Similar, see the **Find Similar** topic in the **Web
User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started** documentation[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

Create and Initiate in Workflow
-------------------------------

Once a record is created, it will be automatically initiated into a
workflow.

Workflow Task and Ad-Hoc Edits
------------------------------

By leveraging STEP Workflows, the operational processes such as
onboarding, enrichment, and maintenance of master data may be closely
owned by various departmental stakeholders across the organization.

The onboarding workflow allows for detailed enrichment of the new
customer record as well as various business conditions to ensure data
integrity is upheld.

Users may be presented with the following options:

-   Save -- Edits made to the new record may be saved. It is not
    uncommon that the save button executes data verification business
    action(s), such as address verification.
-   Submit -- Saved edits to a new record may then be submitted to the
    next state of the workflow. Data validation may also take place on
    submission to the next state.
-   Delete -- User has the option to delete the new record if necessary.

For more information, see the **Workflows in Web UI** topic in the **Web
User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started** documentation[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

All user actions available are dependent upon the user privileges
afforded to said user. It is recommended that privileges are afforded to
users based on their role. For example, a logistics specialist cannot
delete a record. Only the MDM Specialist or some other system
administrative role can be granted all privileges. For more information,
see the Privilege Rules topic in the System Setup / Super User Guide
documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

For ad-hoc edits, like edits to an existing record outside of any
particular workflow, the user will be presented with the following
options:

-   Save -- Edits made to the new record may be saved. It is not
    uncommon that the save button executes data verification business
    action(s), such as address verification. Data validation may also
    take place at this point to ensure data integrity is upheld.
-   Request Approval -- Approval of changes to the customer record
    should be the responsibility of the MDM Specialist. This action will
    initiate the record into an Approval workflow for the approval.
    Further data validations may take place within this workflow to
    ensure data integrity.

Upon final approval of the customer record, a match event will be
generated for the matching event processor to execute matching with the
newly created record.

Approved Workspace
------------------

Data promoted to the approved workspace should be considered as having
been validated and completed. Approved customer data may be synchronized
to a downstream system to drive external business processes and/or
analytics.

Matching Event Processor
------------------------

Whenever customer records are approved, this will trigger a match event.
The event will trigger the match algorithm to execute and compare the
new or existing golden record with the entire dataset of customer
records.

Prior to matching, the customer record under treatment will have its
match codes updated. During matching, data within the Approved workspace
is to be evaluated. At this juncture, there are two solution paths that
may be taken; the decision of which should be determined using the
business requirements gathered by the implementation team.

Merge and Auto-Approve Matches
------------------------------

In the event that a resulting match score is above the auto-merge
threshold, candidates will be merged by the system. Survivorship rules
will update the merged record within the Main workspace and auto-approve
the changes to promote to the Approved workspace.

There may still be a clerical review threshold should it be dictated by
the business requirements.

Review all Matches
------------------

All match scores above a certain threshold are considered as potential
matches and candidates will be manually reviewed. Survivorship rules
will auto-initiate the potential candidates into an Approval / Clerical
Review workflow to be reviewed by an MDM specialist.

Match scores that fall beneath a certain threshold may be automatically
considered as non-matches.

Outbound Integration Endpoint
-----------------------------

Whenever customer records are approved, an export event will trigger.
This allows the mastered data to be synchronized with various downstream
systems.
