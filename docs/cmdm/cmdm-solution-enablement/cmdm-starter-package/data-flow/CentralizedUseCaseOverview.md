Centralized Use Case Overview
=============================

[CleanGoods Manufacturer]{.bold} is a reputable company in the Consumer
Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. CleanGoods specializes in the
manufacturing and distributing of cleaning supplies, catering to both
the average household consumer and professional products lines of
business. As both a manufacturer and distributor of their own products,
CleanGoods requires a customer master data management solution to manage
the business customers with whom they do business. The CMDM solution
must accommodate and master all operational activities involved in the
processes of onboarding new customers as well as maintaining existing
ones.

Furthermore, the CMDM solution must also accommodate for the multiple
Lines of Businesses (LoBs). In addition to their household cleaning
products, they also operate a line of business for profession cleaning
supplies and another line of business for backyard barbecue charcoal.

Since multiple departments and roles are actively involved in the
onboarding and maintenance processes, the CMDM solution must provide a
way to elegantly accommodate each role so they may carry out their
tasks, ensuring that customers are uniquely managed via deduplication
algorithm(s). Additionally, the CMDM solution must also execute all
operational and regulatory validations on the data to enforce the data
integrity of CleanGood's customer data.

[BlueBox Retailer]{.bold} is a nationally recognized chain of retail
stores. The business model of BlueBox Retailer is to market itself as a
one-stop shop for the average consumer to meet all their purchasing
needs. As such, BlueBox carries and sells everything from household
goods, furniture, automotive equipment, children's toys,
pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and groceries. Due to the broad
range of consumer products carried, BlueBox Retailer works with numerous
manufacturers and distributors to negotiate the best purchase price as
well as maintaining optimal inventory levels for all regions of their
e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations.

Considerations
--------------

-   Targets North America as its primary market
-   Sells through various sales channels: Retailers & Distributors
-   Does not currently have a centralized master data repository that
    supports their existing CRM & ERP platforms

Also, it needs to be noted that sales include multiple lines of business
that may target the same customers. For example, brands that specialize
in household cleaners, professional cleaners, even recreational
consumables such as charcoal for barbecue grills may all target the same
retailers and/or distributors.

Challenges
----------

-   Logistical operations due to poor master data, such as missed
    deliveries, inaccurate inventory management, etc.
-   Business analytics and reporting due to duplicate customer records
    and inaccurate customer hierarchies across different lines of
    businesses, like sales reporting and trade promotion planning
-   Inefficiency in customer creation processes, leading to poor data
    quality, delays in deliveries, etc.
-   Account management challenges, conflicts in term negotiations, etc.

Data Management Improvement Plan
--------------------------------

CleanGoods has strategically planned the evolution of how their customer
data will mature over the course of the next few years. To accomplish
this long-term goal, an enterprise strategy plan is laid out in two
phases with each phase progressively building on top of the previous
one.

[Phase 1]{.bold} -- CleanGoods has decided to implement MDM first
following a consolidation implementation method. This method allows them
to get started on their MDM journey, providing immediate value with the
least effort and the least change in business processes and
organization. At the same time, CleanGoods can decide with how to best
move further on their MDM journey. The objectives are briefly explained
below:

-   Use MDM technologies to achieve a single, consolidated customer view
    which should be as complete and up-to-date as their existing
    business processes can deliver it, across all lines of business
-   Establish baselines and improve analytical reporting accuracy for a
    better stewardship experience
-   Consolidate and build out customer hierarchies across lines of
    businesses
-   Enrich customer master data with third-party data from D&B and other
    data providers to ease the consolidation of hierarchies and
    classifications and to identify duplicate records and to improve
    business analytics
-   Improve buyer relationships and efficiency of contract negotiations

[Phase 2]{.bold} - CleanGoods would like to ensure their customer data
is governed and can be trusted across the entire organization. To
accomplish this, CleanGoods has decided to progress their MDM journey
following a centralized implementation method:

-   Change and optimize existing business processes for capturing
    customer master data
-   Use MDM technologies to efficiently drive and govern the process of
    establishing unique, accurate, complete, and up-to-date customer
    records, and push these records out to operational systems as well
    as downstream systems such as business analytics.
