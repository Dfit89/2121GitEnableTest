CMDMÂ Data Flow
==============

This section of the enablement materials details the flow of customer
data into and within MDM for both Coexistence and Centralized
methodologies. Depending on the implementation style, the origination
and flow of customer data differs with respect to the MDM and any
corresponding source systems.

For more information on the various implementation methodologies of MDM,
please refer to the **Customer Master Data Management Overview** section
of this documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

For examples of how the data flows into STEP within the context of a
Coexistence solution, see the **Data Flow for Consolidation and
Coexistence CMDM** topic in this documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor
style="color: Blue;"}.

For examples of how the data flows into STEP within the context of a
Centralized solution, see the **Data Flow for Centralized CMDM in B2B
Solutions** topic in this documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor
