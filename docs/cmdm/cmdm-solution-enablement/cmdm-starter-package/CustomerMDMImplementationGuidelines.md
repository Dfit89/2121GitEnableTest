Customer MDM Implementation Guidelines
======================================

The Customer Master Data Management Implementation Guidelines provide
organizations with baseline configurations and sample data to help get
their STEP Systems off the ground and guide them in the creation of
their Customer MDM solution.

This user guide offers a number of resources that can help achieve this
goal:

-   A generic Customer MDM use case that accounts for both B2C and B2B
    solutions, and provides context for system configuration and
    solution design. For more information, see the **Use Case Overview**
    section of this user guide[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;" conditions="Primary.Web"}.
-   A series of component-specific use cases that tie into the generic
    Customer MDM use case mentioned above. For more information, see the
    **Use Case Appendix** section of this user guide[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;" conditions="Primary.Web"}.
-   A comprehensive guide for how data flows in and out of the STEP
    system, including Matching. For more information, see the
    **CMDM Data Flow** section ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}) and the **Matching** section
    ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}) of this user guide.
-   A comprehensive guide for modeling the data in STEP. For more
    information, see the **Data Modeling** section of this user guide[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;" conditions="Primary.Web"}.
-   A comprehensive guide for data stewardship. For more information,
    see the **Data Stewardship** section of this user guide[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;" conditions="Primary.Web"}.
-   For the configuration of a base CMDM solution and how to deploy it,
    see the **CMDM Configuration Guide** section of this user guide[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

This guide references supporting configuration documentation that exists
in other sections of the STEP Online Help.
