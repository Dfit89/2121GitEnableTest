Email Completeness Policy
=========================

Dylan and Sonya are both data stewards within ACME Group whose team is
responsible for analyzing and reporting on organizational governance
across the globe. Dylan is responsible for ACME Healthcare in the US,
whereas Sonya is responsible for ACME Inc. in Brazil.

To assist in planning for an upcoming promotional campaign, ACME Group
would like to analyze the current quality of contact information of
their customers across the two business units. Since the digital age
means email is the engine that drives all digital campaigns, having
reliable email addresses of their customers is key to achieving their
quarterly fiscal goals.

To accomplish this goal, ACME Group would like to evaluate email
completeness over a period to identify trends in data quality and devise
internal process improvements to improve email quality.
