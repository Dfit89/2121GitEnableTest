ACME Holding Group Example Case
===============================

The parent company Acme Group operates across three business units; ACME
Healthcare, ACME Inc., and Obits Technologies. Each business unit spans
across multiple countries.

The three business units operate independently, but have a large overlap
in customer base. It is a company strategy to align the business units
in a customer centric way around one central brand that services the
customers end-to-end. As part of this journey, customer master data must
be aligned between the three business units across the various
countries. For that purpose, ACME Group is turning to Stibo Systems\'
CMDM solution to help address their needs.

There is not much overlap in the customer base across countries. Because
of this, information stewardship is divided between each country, as
there are many country-specific quirks in the data that local people can
more easily deal with. To facilitate this organizational stewardship,
Acme Group has established a governance organization with members from
each business unit in each country. This organization will define a set
of local policies for many different things. They expect that the MDM
platform can monitor and report on these policies.

While customer data across various countries may adhere to different
standards of completeness, it is widely accepted by ACME that the data
being considered while evaluating completeness of a record shall remain
the same. As such, ACME has determined that they require scoring metrics
to be agreed upon across the organization. From there, individual
policies may be built on top of the metrics to better define the
country-specific thresholds that are appropriate.

Furthermore, since the focus of each business unit and country may be
different, it is not easy for the team to understand what they should
monitor. Therefore, some metrics may not be shared and must be
considered as separate metrics for each business unit-country
combination. In other instances, some metrics may be shared, however,
the policy thresholds may be different.
