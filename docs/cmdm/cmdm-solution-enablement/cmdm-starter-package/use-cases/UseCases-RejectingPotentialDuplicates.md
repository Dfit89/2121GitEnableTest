Use Cases - Rejecting Potential Duplicates
==========================================

ACME may want to keep two matched records as separate records under
certain circumstances. In such a scenario, a data steward can determine
if two or more records in a clerical review workflow should merge or
stay as separate entities. As an example, Jonathan Dorthy & Jenkin
Doorthy are different people but were flagged as potential duplicates
due to their similar names.

These potential duplicates are displayed via a clerical review task list
in Web UI, where the data steward can reject the task to keep Jonathan
Dorthy & Jenkin Doorthy from merging. Once rejected, the customer
records remain as separate records.
