Use Cases - Address Validation
==============================

ACMEÂ requires that address be validated via Loqate whenever a customer
record is updated. In this scenario, Jason Kirby has moved to a new
address. To account for this change, a data steward navigates to the
customer record and manually updates the data. A Loqate request is sent,
and new standardized data is returned based on the Jason Kirby\'s new
address.

Typically, this kind of update would come through via a source system,
in which case it would have already been validated upon import into
STEP. In this scenario, there are no actions required by a data steward.
