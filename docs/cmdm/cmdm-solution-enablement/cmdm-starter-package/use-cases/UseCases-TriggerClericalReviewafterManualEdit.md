Use Cases - Trigger Clerical Review after Manually Editing Customer Record
==========================================================================

Sometimes ACME requires customer records to be manually edited inÂ STEP
to address errors in data quality. In this scenario, STEP identifies a
new potential duplicate after the customer record for Kimberley Kaine
had the spelling of her first name corrected. Once identified as a
potential duplicate, a task is created in a clerical review workflow.

The data steward concludes that they are duplicate records and chooses
to merge them into a single golden record.
