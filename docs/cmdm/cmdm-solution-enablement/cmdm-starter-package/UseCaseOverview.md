Use Case Overview
=================

To illustrate how the CMDM solution can address common challenges an
organization faces, the use cases presented in this section use
fictional companies with typical business considerations and problems.
Understanding these use case examples will provide additional context to
the configuration steps included in this guide, as well as the more
granular use cases that concern specific CMDMÂ components.

Two over-arching use cases are detailed in this section:

-   The ACME Company use case provides details on Coexistence style
    implementations. For details on this use case, see the
    **Consolidation and Coexistence Use Case Overview** section of the
    documentation[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
-   The CleanGoods Manufacturer use case provides details on Centralized
    style implementations. For details on this use case, see the
    **Centralized Use Case Overview** section of the documentation[
    here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
