Use Case
--------

Pearl is a data steward who works closely with the marketing department
to build seasonal campaigns and corresponding collateral. Today, the use
of digital marketing platform to drive sales, increase brand awareness,
and promote customer loyalty is widespread. This implies that for
marketing strategies to succeed, having the proper contact information
for customers and prospective customers is paramount.

ACME's marketing department relies on email contacts provided by
existing customers within loyalty programs as well as other marketing
initiatives. To assist with ensuring success of the campaign, Pearl is
tasked with making sure that email addresses are valid within the
customer master (CMDM). By having an analysis of the accuracy of email
addresses, ACME may then determine the cause of any discrepancies with
the existing workflow of gathering email contacts.

In leveraging CMDM's email validation solution using Experian, Pearl is
able to validate email addresses in bulk. Validated email data may then
be synchronized with the marketing team's CRM application. Having
validated their email contacts, Pearl can now search for and identify
the various reasons email address may be bad or unreachable. For more
