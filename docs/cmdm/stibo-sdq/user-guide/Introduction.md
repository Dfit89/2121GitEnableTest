Introduction
============

Low-quality and duplicated data can significantly raise the cost of
doing business. This is why maintaining clean, consistent, and thorough
data in Salesforce is imperative for business efficiency. Because a
customer\'s profile is ever-changing, it is important for businesses to
strive for a single view of the customer. To provide this view, key
stakeholders in your organization must have a 360-degree view of the
customers with whom they interact.
