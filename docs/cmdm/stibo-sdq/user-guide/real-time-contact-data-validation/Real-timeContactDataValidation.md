Real-time Contact Data Validation
=================================

With Stibo SDQ, contact data is validated globally and in real-time with
address, email, and phone verification displayed in Salesforce at the
point of entry. In other words, users can validate contact information
for existence and reach-ability (a validation that gives you actionable
results) while creating contact data in Salesforce. This ensures only
verified and accurate contact data enters Salesforce.

Once contact data has been created, and edits have been made, it is
possible to configure an automatic validation that will revalidate
contact data whenever a change is made. For more information, see the
**Enable Async Validation** section of the **Stibo SDQ Admin Guide**.

Within this section the following real-time overarching capabilities are
addressed:

-   Address Validation ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
-   Email Validation ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
-   Phone Validation ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})

In the example below, Stibo SDQ phone, email, and address validation
functionality are displayed for an end user within a standard Salesforce
page. Display configurations may vary widely.
