Dun & Bradstreet Enrichment
===========================

Stibo SDQ makes it easier than ever to ensure your organization has the
latest Dun & Bradstreet information. The Dun & Bradstreet Enrichment
theme allows users to enrich accounts by leveraging high-quality
business data from Dun & Bradstreet with the click of a button.

Because Stibo SDQ seamlessly integrates with Dun & Bradstreet, users can
easily enrich and augment Salesforce records with industry-leading
company information from Dun & Bradstreet. This includes adding a
D-U-N-S number, and 220+ firmographic, hierarchical, and contacts to
your organizations Salesforce Business Accounts.

Once configured, Dun & Bradstreet enrichment can be accessed within
Salesforce via these three action buttons:

-   DUNS Lookup Action Button[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}
-   D&B Enrich Action Button [here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}
-   D&B Sync Contacts Action Button[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}

In the example below, when an account is displayed within Salesforce
Lightning Experience, the action buttons can be accessed by clicking on
the action button dropdown. The red arrows indicate the three Dun &
Bradstreet action buttons.

When using Salesforce Classic, the dropdown is not used to access the
action buttons.
