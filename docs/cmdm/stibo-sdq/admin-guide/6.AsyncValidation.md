Async Validation
================

To take full advantage of the data quality functionality, Data Quality
Mappings with enabled (Web-to-Object) flag are highly recommended, and
all of the validation triggers must be present and active. Select the
checkbox when mapping fields.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/EnablingAsync.png)

Validation will be performed on:

-   Record Creation, if a value is entered for a field which is
    configured in a Data Quality mapping, and the Validation Status and
    Validation Timestamp fields are empty.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Record Modification, if a value is modified for a field which is
    configured in a Data Quality mapping, or if any modification is made
    to the object and there is a field which is configured in a Data
    Quality mapping.

\
This is an asynchronous process and might take some time to be performed
after record saving. If a value is modified for a field which is
configured in a Data Quality mapping and the validation triggers are
present then, before the actual update of the record, Validation Status
and Validation Timestamp fields' values will be set to empty regardless
of if you have Async Validation (Web-to-Object) enabled. Then, only if
you have Async Validation (Web-to-Object) enabled, after a short delay,
validation will be performed and the record will be updated with
relevant data which is configured in the output section of the Data
Quality mapping.\
\
Validation will NOT be performed if the user is creating a record
through Search Before Create functionality and validation has already
been performed on the initial screen.

Account Validation Triggers

Before any input can be validated, triggers must be configured. To
configure triggers for the Account object:

Navigate to Setup \> Object Manager \> Accounts \> **Triggers**.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/TriggerNavigation.png)

The Apex Trigger editing page will load. In the Apex Trigger field,
enter the following code snippet:

    trigger StiboAccountValidationStatus on Account (before insert, before update) {

``` {space="preserve"}
   if (Trigger.isInsert) {
```

``` {space="preserve"}
     stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.prepareSObjects(Trigger.new);
```

``` {space="preserve"}
  } else if (Trigger.isUpdate) {
```

``` {space="preserve"}
      stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.prepareSObjects(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap);
```

``` {space="preserve"}
  }
```

``` {space="preserve"}
}
```

Select \'Save,\' and navigate back to the Object Manager \> Account \>
**Triggers** page. Create another new trigger with the following code:

    trigger StiboAccountAsyncValidation on Account (after insert, after update) {

``` {space="preserve"}
 stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.validateSobjects(Trigger.new);
```

    }

Save the trigger.

Contact Validation Triggers

Before any input can be validated, triggers must be configured. To
configure triggers for the Account object:

Navigate to Setup \> Object Manager \> Contact \> **Triggers**.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/ContactTriggerNavigation.png)

The Apex Trigger editing page will load. In the Apex Trigger field,
enter the following code snippet:

    trigger StiboContactValidationStatus on Contact (before insert, before update) {

``` {space="preserve"}
   if (Trigger.isInsert) {
```

``` {space="preserve"}
     stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.prepareSObjects(Trigger.new);
```

``` {space="preserve"}
  } else if (Trigger.isUpdate) {
```

``` {space="preserve"}
      stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.prepareSObjects(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap);
```

``` {space="preserve"}
  }
```

    }

Select \'Save,\' and navigate back to the Object Manager \> Contact \>
**Triggers** page. Create another new trigger with the following code:

    trigger StiboContactAsyncValidation on Contact (after insert, after update) {

``` {space="preserve"}
 stibo_dq.ValidatorTriggerService.validateSobjects(Trigger.new);
```

    }

Save the trigger.

Scheduling a Task Synchronizer
------------------------------

To see and review Clerical review tasks in Stibo SDQ, the Task
Synchronizer must be started and scheduled. This process is done in the
Developer\'s Console.

The Developer\'s Console is most easily accessible from the Classic
Experience. This section will be done in that view.

In Salesforce, open the Developer\'s Console by selecting the user name
dropdown, then selecting \'Developer Console.\'

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/SelectDevelopersConsole.png)

In the Developer Console, select Debug \> **Open Execute Anonymous
Window**.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/OpenExecutionWindow.png)

Enter the following string, modifying minutes and hour to the desired
time. In the following example, the time will run at 5:30PM, local user
time:

    String minutes = '30';

    String hour = '17';

    System.schedule('StepTaskSynchronizer', '0 ' + minutes + ' ' + hour + ' * * ?', new stibo_dq.TaskSyncScheduler());

Select \'Execute\' to run the code. Note, that if there is other text in
the console, you can highlight the above code then select the \'Execute
Highlighted\' to only run that selected code.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/ExecuteApex.png)

To check the scheduled jobs, go to Setup \> **Scheduled Jobs**. These
can be unscheduled by deleting it from the UI.

![](../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/AdminGuide/ScheduledJobsUI.png)

Linking functionality requires using a custom object that links two
Standard Salesforce object (Account or Contact). The two linked objects
in Salesforce are called \'Master\' and \'Lookup\'. When a Master object
is deleted the custom link object is deleted as well, but when a Lookup
object is deleted, the link custom object is not deleted. This is a
Salesforce limitation, and it can lead to \'orphans\'.

To schedule an orphan cleaning task, run the following command in
Development console:

    System.schedule('OrphanLinkCleanupScheduler', '0 0 0 * * ? *', new OrphanLinkCleanupScheduler());

This Schedule job will run every 24 hours at 12:00 pm, making sure all
of the linking orphans are cleaned up.
