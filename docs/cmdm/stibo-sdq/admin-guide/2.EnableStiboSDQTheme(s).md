Enable Stibo SDQ Theme(s)
=========================

In Stibo SDQ, each feature package is called a theme. Each theme is
configured completely separate from the others.

In this guide, each theme\'s configurations will be explained. To
configure any of the themes, select \'Settings\' under the desired theme
from the left menu pane.

Once the first theme is configured, admin users will no longer see the
previous image. Instead, they will need to click into the settings of
each additional theme to configure.
