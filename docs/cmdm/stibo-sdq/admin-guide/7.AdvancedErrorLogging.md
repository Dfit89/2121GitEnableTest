Advanced Error Logging
======================

To track various issues within Stibo SDQ, an advanced error log is
available. To generate important and meaningful error messages, you must
ensure that the log level is set to at least \'Critical.\' To check this
setting, under Advanced on the left navigational panel, select
\'Settings.\'

The log level can be seen on this screen. The options are \'Critical,\'
\'Warning,\' \'Info,\' or \'Disabled.\'

After this level is set, the error log will collect all errors at that
level or greater. To see these logs, from the side navigation bar,
select \'Error Logs\' under \'Advanced.\'

The reports will show the date that they occurred, the severity of the
error, and any generated messages to help with troubleshooting.

There is no way to automatically delete old logs.
