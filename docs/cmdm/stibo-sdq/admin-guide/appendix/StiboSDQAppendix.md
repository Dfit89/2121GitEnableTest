Stibo SDQ Appendices
====================

Additional Salesforce Administrator Information {#additional-salesforce-administrator-information .RNNoTOC}
-----------------------------------------------

Stibo SDQ provides a great deal of functionality. However, some options
require additional configurations.

-   To receive email notifications, particularly when there is an error,
    see the **Email Notifications** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"}.

Address Field Descriptions Appendix {#address-field-descriptions-appendix .RNNoTOC}
-----------------------------------

As part of the real-time contact data validation, Stibo SDQ interacts
with a service that exposes a range of data for addresses. In the
implementation described in the **Real-time Contact Data Validation -
Address Mapping** section in this guide, only a subset of this data is
stored in Salesforce.

Additional data may be extracted from this service and used to enrich
address information. This extra data requires additional output
mappings. See the **Real-time Contact Data Validation - Address
Mapping** section of this guide for more information.
