Set Up a User Profile
=====================

Stibo SDQ introduces new features for standard users and Data Stewards.
Standard users must be given access to certain Salesforce objects, so
that they can get access to Real-Time Validation, D&B Enrichment, and
Search Before Create features. Data Stewards must be setup as System
administrators, so that they can access the Stibo SDQ Landing Page tab.
The standard users who need to create records and may need access to
some of the Visualforce pages will need a separate group with specified
privileges to just see and access what they need.

The MDM theme also requires a System Administrator account, see the
\'Verify\' subsection of the \'MDM Theme\' section for more details.

The following permissions are required for standard users:

-   Access to the Visualforce pages so that standard users can validate
    and enrich data and create new records
-   Access to the Error log object to allow these users to handle errors
    that may arise
-   Access to Apex so that the code may run properly

Select Profile
--------------

Navigate to the Users settings option in Setup. Then, create a new
profile or select an existing profile that should have access to the
Stibo SDQ native Salesforce functionality.
