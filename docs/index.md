Solution Enablement
===================

This section of STEP Online Help includes information for enabling
product-specific solutions: Master Data Management (MDM) and Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM). Having the information on how to implement a
solution (including, in some cases, an accelerated architecture), and
why to implement it as described, allows users to better understand the
overall solutions and available functionality.
