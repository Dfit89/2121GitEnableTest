            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">Internal Note: RDCUST-</MadCap:conditionalText>New Advanced tab in the Mapping Guide window to handle attribute transformations on multivalued attributes</p>
        <p class="Image3">The Mapping Guide window now has the Advanced tab that allows users to perform some advanced transformation functionalities when required. The functionalities in this tab are mainly designed to handle multivalued source attributes.</p>
        <p class="Body3">While the attribute transformation configured in the Mapping tab is applied to the values of the source attribute, the attribute transformation configured in the Advanced tab will be applied to the intermittent string that gets created during the transition of data from the source attribute to the target attribute.</p>
        <p class="Body3">For example, consider that data is being onboarded into a single-valued target attribute (named 'Body Color') from a multivalued source attribute (Color) with an attribute transformation that changes the value from the upper case to the lower case. The source attribute Color has three values, RED, BLUE, and BLACK. If the attribute transformation was set in the Transformation field of the Mapping tab, the target attribute Body Color would be populated with a value 'black' (because the target attribute can accommodate only one value). However, before it populates this value in the target attribute, it is to be known that in the background, the system creates an intermittent string called 'red&lt;multisep/&gt;blue&lt;multisep/&gt;black' and extracts only the value 'black' out of this string to populate on the target attribute. Now, with the introduction of the Advanced tab, it is possible to configure and apply another attribute transformation on this string, and users can transform and retrieve the desired data from this string to be populated in the target attribute value. For example, if the On Save Transformation field is populated with an attribute transformation that replaces the '&lt;multisep/&gt;' substring into the hyphen '-', then the final value in the target attribute will be populated as 'red-blue-black'.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Along with the functionality described above, the Advanced tab can also be used for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet4">Ensure that no duplicate values are populated in the target attribute by selecting the Distinct checkbox</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Determine if the value of a LOV or the ID of the LOV value is to be populated in the target attributes using the 'UseValueOnValueID' checkbox</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">The features in this tab would be of no significance when the transformations are to be applied on single valued source attributes. It means that the attribute transformation configured in the Advanced tab would behave normally as the attribute transformations being configured and applied for the single valued attributes in the Mapping tab (screenshot below). However, the significance of the attribute transformations configured in this tab kick in when there is a multivalued source attribute. This ststement violates with the </p>

        <p class="Body3">Clicking on the 'Add' icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/165.png" />) that is available within the Target Hierarchy Editor window allowed users to set criteria that could be used to define the name and ID of the newly created objects. Previously, if there were multiple criteria created within the Target Hierarchy Editor window, users did not have an option to rearrange the order of the listed criteria. Now, a new three-dotted icon (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/three dotted icon.png" />) is made available to the right of each criteria to display the rearranging dialog. The user can select the Top, Up, Down, or Bottom button to rearrange the transformation accordingly.</p>

        <p class="Body3">The Suggested Part Number table header component which can be configured in the Application Manager Screen and the Application Editor Screen is updated with an option that determines if the table cell has to display the ID, Name, or with an attribute value of the suggested part number. Previously, the table cell was defaulted to display only the ID of the suggested part number. Now, two new parameters (Display ID and Attribute) have been added in the Suggested Part Number Properties designer window. These parameters determine if the ID or name or the attribute value of the suggested part number to be displayed within the table cell. the Display ID parameter defaults to the 'NODE_ID' value. This allows the Id of the suggested part number to display within the cell. Optionally, the 'NAME_VALUE' or 'ATTRIBUTE_VALUE' value can be selected using the dropdown. While the 'NAME_VALUE' displays the name of the suggested part number, the 'ATTRIBUTE_VALUE' allows the values of the attribute selected within the 'Attribute' parameter to display within the cell. The Attribute parameter allows the user to populate with an attribute that is valid for the suggested part number. The Attribute parameter should only be populated when the 'ATTRIBUTE_VALUE' value is selected in the Display ID parameter. Otherwise, the defined attribute value will not be displayed in the cell.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, AutoCare Easy Setup did not create certain PIES attributes as mandatory or with the correct format in order to meet the validation requirements. Now, Easy Setup and certain parameters in the PIES Exporter 'Select Format' step have been updated in order to fix the PIES attributes to meet the validation requirements that are provided in the PIES spec. It is to be noted that the changes that have been done to Easy Setup will only take effect when newly creating PIES attributes and will not update existing attributes in the system. All existing implementations will need to manually change for PIES attributes.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, there was some synchronization problem between the search boxes and the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown in the Application Manager screen that failed to filter the search results based on the criteria defined in the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown. This synchronization problem occurred only when there was any criteria defined in the Make / Model search box and/or Part Type search box but there was no criteria defined in the Year search box. This issue is now resolved so that the criteria set in the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown will always be considered irrespective of the presence / absence of the criteria set in the Year search box.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the 'Context' method delta calculation used in the PIES Importer did not compare the Pricing and Description data from the PIES file against the existing respective data containers in the system. This caused the same PIES Item to be imported again thereby causing PIES imports to be slower than needed. Now, the 'Context' method of delta calculation is updated to compare the Pricing and Description information from the PIES file against the respective data containers existing in the system. If the existing PIES Item data in the system matches the data in the PIES file being imported, then such PIES Item will be excluded from being imported into the system.</p>

Previously, the attribute information of 'Expiration Date' and 'Effective Date' were being retrieved from &lt;PriceSheet&gt; and &lt;Price&gt; segments of the importing PIES file, and were populated in the data container of the PIES Item.

        <p class="Body3">Corrected an error in Conversion state that would occur while importing the TecDoc Supplier Data file. Previously, the absence of TAF table 702 and TAF table 701 in the loaded supplier file would cause a stacktrace error to occur during conversion. These tables have now been removed from validation, therefore the validation state no longer displays the '<i>Conversion failed: Missing file '702.102'. Please include this file in the import even though it is empty</i>' and '<i>Conversion failed: Missing file '701.102'. Please include this file in the import even though it is empty</i>' message.</p>
