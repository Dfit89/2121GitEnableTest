        <p class="Body3">The MapperBackgroundService used in the 'Run background process action' business rule now has the 'Clear change attribute' parameter. When checked, this parameter will clear the flag set in the attribute configured within the 'Changed attribute' parameter after the Mapper Configuration setup entity is executed. This parameter prevents the Mapper Configuration setup entity to be executed multiple times on the same Source object over subsequent imports.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the PIES importer did not handle existing STEP attribute values that have been deleted in the current PIES import file. The PIES importer would ignore the deleted value in the import file and left the existing attribute value untouched. In addition, the PIES importer did not handle overwriting existing Description data containers that had changed, but instead created a new description. Now, PIES importer has been updated to include replacement rules that checks the previously imported file to compare to the current file that is getting imported. If the previous import populated an attribute value and the current import does not contain the same attribute, then the import will update the existing attribute value to be null. Also, if the current imported file has a change to an existing Description data container, the existing data container will get overwritten instead of getting a new description created.</p>
        <p class="note3" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt; "> The PIES importer Delta calculation method parameter must be set to 'file' in order for this update work properly. Also, the previously imported file must be retained in the system in order for the current import file to use for comparison.</p>

        <p class="Body3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Target (assembly / vehicle or part) search accuracy has been improved by taking both the Condition and Part Type values into consideration. Previously, when searching for relevant targets (assembly / vehicle or part) in Faceted Search dialog, conditions for specific part types were not considered, resulting in the display of invalid targets (assembly / vehicle or part). For example, when searching for a 2013 Audi A3 vehicle for a selected spark plug, the results table would list both Gas and Diesel engines, even though Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and are invalid in the search results. Now, we have improved the targets search by introducing an existing Business Condition plugin ('Check path for missing application') in the Faceted Search dialog where a validation path can be configured so that the invalid targets for a specific part type are filtered away, and only valid values are returned.</p>

        <p class="Body3">In the Application Manager Screen, the Options Group Search Box within the Vehicle Type Search Panel allows users to add attributes and/or references as option search criteria. The Options Group Search Box uses an 'And' or 'Or' operator as a filter when searching between multiple options. Previously, the Application Manager Options search box required both Options boxes to be populated in order to display the correct results. If only one Option box was populated, there would be more results that would be displayed than what was entered for the search criteria. Now, the Application Manager Options search box is corrected to properly sync to form the desired search criteria and display the results accordingly.</p>

        <p class="Body3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">When a file is loaded for an import in the system, the Delta Calculation state of the importer will assess and compare the loaded file against the existing data in the system. Depending on the data provided in the importing file, an attribute value / reference value is either added, changed, or deleted from the system. Previously, the TecDoc Supplier Data Importer Delta Calculation exhibited problems in removing the existing attribute value of an object in the system if the attribute value of an object was removed in the import file over a subsequent Import. The TecDoc Supplier Data Importer Delta Calculation has been fixed so that the existing attribute value of an object is erased in the system if the attribute value is not present on the TecDoc Supplier Data file.</p>
        <p class="Body3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Previously, the PIES importer did not handle existing STEP attribute values that have been deleted in the current PIES import file. The PIES importer would ignore the deleted value in the import file and left the existing attribute value untouched. In addition, the PIES importer did not handle overwriting existing Description data containers that had changed, but instead created a new description. Now, PIES importer has been updated to include replacement rules that checks the previously imported file to compare to the current file that is getting imported. If the previous import populated an attribute value and the current import does not contain the same attribute, then the import will update the existing attribute value to be null. Also, if the current imported file has a change to an existing Description data container, the existing data container will get overwritten instead of getting a new description created.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Corrected an error in Validation state that would occur while importing TecDoc Reference Data file. Previously, the presence of TAF table 115 would cause a stacktrace error to occur during conversion.  TAF table 115 has now been removed from validation, therefore the validation state no longer displays the 'Wrong file name or missing in code. Code has not table 115 to file' message.</p>

Additionally, when upgrading any base STEP system that has any Automotive add-on installed, both install recipes must be prepared at the same time. </p>
