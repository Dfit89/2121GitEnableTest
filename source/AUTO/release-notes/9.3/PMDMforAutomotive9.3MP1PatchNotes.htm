        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">New 'Search by Card' screen</p>
        <p class="Body3">A new Search by Card screen has been added that uses the sync between search cards functionality to provide an intelligent, easy-to-use search interface. This makes it possible for the user to narrow down the search result and see only relevant results. This screen can be configured to define the most likely used filter groups for the search in the Web UI. For example, if the user needs to find an object based on the name, parent hierarchy, or any attribute value, and the search cards are configured to be available for each of these search criteria in the Search by Card Screen, then users can refine the list of objects based on one or more of the available filters.</p>

        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">New Onboarding Comparison Screen'</p>
        <p class="Body3">Often in the process of Data Onboarding, a large quantity of data is imported and onboarded in the system. Sometimes the process requires the user to preview the changes affecting the Target object before the data is onboarded. The Onboarding Comparison Screen allows users to preview the onboarding data, assess each of the changes, and either accept or reject the changes that will affect the Target object.</p>
        <p class="Body3">The Onboarding Comparison Screen allows users to configure a Mapper Configuration  setup entity and compares the selected Source object with the Target object in the context of the configured Mapper Configuration  setup entity. With the Source object selected, users can view the changes affecting the Target object. Also, an option is provided to partially / fully accept or reject the changes.   If the user chooses to accept full / partial changes, the Mapper Configuration  setup entity will be executed on the Source object and only the selected changes will be implemented on the Target object.</p>
        <p class="Body3">The Onboarding Comparison Screen features the following elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullet4">Name of the Source object</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Multiple stages for each available Mapping plugin within the configured Mapper Configuration  setup entity.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">An additional stage called Confirm to verify the Onboarding selections (detailed in the second screenshot below).</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Mapper rows table toolbar.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Number displaying the total number of changes.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Option to select the Mapping plugin containing the Mapper rows.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Permission to auto-update all future changes.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">An option to collapse the displayed Mapping plugin.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A column displaying current values in the Target object.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A column displaying values in the Source object.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A column displaying values that would be populated in the Target object when the Onboarding is accepted.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Option to select the individual Mapper rows that are to be onboarded.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">An option to abort Onboarding process at any phase.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A business action-driven Reject Update button that enables users to reject updates.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Number displaying the total number of Mapper rows selected in the current stage.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A preview that enables users to verify the selection.</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">A business action driven Onboard button that executes the selected updates.</li>

        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">New 'Forward Screen Action' component</p>
        <p class="Body3">A new Forward Screen Action component has been added that, when configured as an action button, allows users to reroute an object into the defined screen. If placed in the Buttons component, the  Forward Screen Action component will route the currently selected product. If placed in the Actions parameter on a Node List, the  Forward Screen Action component  will route the object that is selected in the list.  This component is commonly used within Web UI search screens and the Node Detail screen.</p>
        <p class="Body3">One common use case of the Forward Screen Action component within the Automotive solution is to route the selected object to the Onboarding Comparison Screen. There are no explicit limits on how the component can be used, but it was created specifically to route the selected object to the Onboarding Comparison Screen so that the user can compare the selected Source object with the Target object in the context of the configured Mapper Configuration setup entity.</p>

        <p class="Body3">The Attribute Mapping plugin, Object to Object Mapping plugin, Concatenator Mapping plugin, and Application Mapping plugin provide users with an option to create attribute transformations. Previously, the Create New Transformation button(<img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/Create transformation icon.png" />), available within the Mapping plugins, would only create the attribute transformation, which required the user to configure and define the functionality of the transformation separately in the workbench. Now, a New Transformation button is available within the Transformation Overview dialog that allows users to add transformations for the existing / newly created attribute transformations.</p>

        <p class="Body3">The Market Copy segment is provided in the PIES file and brought into STEP via the PIES Importer. Previously, the PIES Importer and Exporter handled the &lt;MarketingCopy&gt;  segment, but the 'MarketCopySubCode' and 'MarketCopySubCodeReference' XML elements were not handled correctly within the STEP AutoCare data model. Despite the presence of MarketCopySubCode and MarketCopySubCodeReference elements within the PIES import file, the Market Copy was creating all of the Market Copy objects directly below the Brand level (as shown below).</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the 'AutoCare PIES Exporter' format was hard-coded to include all Digital assets irrespective of their Asset Type, Resolution, Orientation and File Type in the exported file. Also, it was hard-coded to include all attributes related to the Digital assets in the PIES exported file, which prevented users from selecting attributes from the Digital assets to be included / excluded in the exported file. The PIES Exporter has now been updated to include a new parameter called 'Digital Assets' to allow users to select the Digital asset types to be included or excluded in the exported file. The 'Digital Assets' parameter is available within the 'Advanced' tab of the Export Manager. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body3">The parameter allows users to filter Digital assets based on their Asset Type, Resolution, Orientation and File Type, and also provides an option to filter out the Digital Asset attributes that should be excluded from being exported. Clicking the ellipses button (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Buttons/ellipsis.png" class="img_intext" />) that is available next to the parameter will display the Digital Assets dialog (as shown below). </p>

Similarly, if no Asset Type, Resolution, Orientation, and File Type is moved from the Included to the Excluded column, the export continues to function as before and no Digital assets will be excluded from export.</p>
        <p class="Body3">For example, if the user wants to specify that certain Asset Types such as Primary Photo (P04) and User Defined (ZZ1-ZZ9) should be exported, but exclude all other Asset Types, then the user will be able to do that by retaining  Primary Photo (P04) and User Defined (ZZ1-ZZ9) in the Included list and moving the other Asset Types to the Excluded list.</p>
        <p class="Body3">This parameter is available in all the versions of the PIES export.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Following are the features of this parameter: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">The new parameter allows multi attribute selection. If more than one attribute needs to be excluded from the export, users can deselect more than one attribute within the Digital Assets dialog.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">The new parameter provides the flexibility to combine multiple criteria to include the required Digital Assets in the export. For example, criteria to include images of  Primary Photo (P04) Asset Type, .jpg File Type and of 600 dpi resolution. </li>

        <p class="Body3">Target (assembly / vehicle or part) search accuracy has been improved by taking both the Condition and Part Type values into consideration. Previously, when searching for relevant targets (assembly / vehicle or part) in Faceted Search dialog, conditions for specific part types were not considered, resulting in the display of invalid targets (assembly / vehicle or part). For example, when searching for a 2013 Audi A3 vehicle for a selected spark plug, the results table would list both Gas and Diesel engines, even though Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and are invalid in the search results. Now, we have improved the targets search by introducing an existing Business Condition plugin ('Check path for missing application') in the Faceted Search dialog where a validation path can be configured so that the invalid targets for a specific part type are filtered away, and only valid values are returned.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Changed the way the PIES Importer handled the ID pattern of the PIES Market Copy objects so that it would optionally include the MarketCopySubCode and MarketCopySubCodeReference information in the ID. Previously, the PIES Importer was creating IDs with the pattern AC_PIESMKTC_+ hash(MarketCopyCode + MarketCopyType + MarketCopyReference + MarketCopySubCode + MarketCopySubCodeReference + MarketCopyContent). As some manufacturers create Market Copy directly in the system (not through PIES importer), they require an ID format that they can generate on their own which would match what the PIES importer would create. Now, the PIES Importer has been updated to no longer use a hash value in the Market Copy ID. </p>
        <p class="Body3">Since MarketCopySubCode and MarketCopySubCodeReference fields are optional, if those fields do not exist, then the new ID will be in the format AC_MKTC_MarketCopyCode_MarketCopyReference_MarketCopyType_RecordSequence. </p>
        <p class="Body3">And if the values for the MarketCopySubCode and MarketCopySubCodeReference exists, then the new ID will be in the format AC_MKTC_MarketCopyCode_MarketCopyReference_MarketCopySubCode_MarketCopySubCodeReference_MarketCopyType_RecordSequence.</p>
        <p class="Body3">If a Market Copy object is first created in the system without the MarketCopySubCode and SubCodeReference, and then later on the MarketCopySubCode and SubCodeReference is added on the same object over subsequent import, then that object will be considered as a new object because the object ID will differ. If an existing Market Copy object exists in the system and the Market Copy content is changed, then the system will rewrite to the existing object because the MarketCopy Code, Reference, SubCode, SubCodeReference, MarketCopyType, and Record Sequence will be the same.</p>
