        <p>One new table transformation, an enhancement of an existing table transformation, and three new text transformations have been introduced to the PMDM for Automotive print solution. The table transformations are: </p>

        <h3 class="RNOrange">Enhanced 'Row Consolidation' transformation</h3>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note"> PRODOC note:&#160;Automotive only</p>
        <p class="Body1">The automotive Row Consolidation transformation has been enhanced to allow for adjacent rows to be consolidated (merged together) based on the data in <i>more than one</i> column being different. Previously, the Row Consolidation transformation would only allow for two adjacent rows to be consolidated if the data in just <i>one</i> specified column was different. The updated Row Consolidation transformation allows for adjacent rows to be consolidated even when the data in multiple columns is different. It also handles the special situation with the consolidation of date ranges.</p>
        <p>The following example shows a table as it appears before the transformation is applied. The first 5 rows (light blue background) can be consolidated to one row, and the next two rows (light yellow) can also be consolidated to one row. The columns that have been allowed to have different values are: Model, Type, Eng Code, and the four columns that denote the start / end year and month. Therefore, by elimination, the data in columns Make, #Cyl, Eng Size, Fuel, and KW must be identical for any consolidation to take effect. </p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoRowConsol_Before.png" />
        </p>
        <p>After applying the transformation—which will consolidate multiple rows by repeatedly comparing two adjacent rows—the result will resemble the following. The differing values in the Model, Type, and Eng Code columns remain; identical values in the Make, #Cyl, Eng Size, Fuel, and KW columns have been merged into one single value; and the differing values in the start / end year and month columns have been merged into date ranges.</p>

        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note:  RDPRT-3867</p>
        <p>A new 'Assign Row/Column Types to Row/Column Numbers' table transformation has been introduced to allow users to assign row and/or column types to fixed row / column numbers. This is especially useful after a Pivot Transformation has been applied.  </p>
        <p>Automotive tables tend to be very structured, using a consistent number of columns with the  same attributes in the same order, and have fixed column widths. The number of columns can be quite high—15 or more columns is not unusual. It is also very common that the Pivot Transformation is required in these tables.</p>
        <p>The Pivot Transformation does not allow for the assignment of so many different column types to the 'common values' columns. This new transformation solves this issue by allowing users to assign column types to these columns after the Pivot Transformation. Further, it can define the designation of header row types instead of using the Pivot Transformation. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The following example shows a table in which this transformation will be used to apply two different column types to four different columns (columns 7, 8, 9, and 10).</p>
        <p class="Body1">Before the transformation is applied, the columns have no background shading: </p>

        <p class="Body1">A new 'Sort values within cells' text transformation has been introduced that sorts multiple values when they are contained within a single table cell. It is available as a selection in the following locations: </p>

        </ul>
        <p>Entries within a cell may be sorted alphabetically, numerically, or by fractional values, and in ascending or descending order. Since the sorting affects multiple values within a single cell, a separator (value delimiter) must be placed between the values to differentiate them. If a hard return should separate the entries in a cell, the delimiter of \n should be used.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: Users may enter one or more characters to indicate the delimiter between the entries in a cell. The hard and soft return codes (\n and \r) are accepted characters. Do users literally type in \n or \r or do they just hit the Enter key or hit Shift+Enter? Ask TWST and AJJE I guess. </p>
        <p>The following examples use the pipe character (|) as the delimiter: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">The value string '2002|2007|2005|2012' becomes '2002|2005|2007|2012' when sorted using the Ascending and Numeric options.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">'A|C|H|B|G ' becomes 'A|B|C|G|H' when sorted using the Ascending and Alphabetic options.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">'DC7|DC9|DC13|DC12|DC5|DC6' becomes 'DC5|DC6|DC7|DC9|DC12|DC13' when sorted using the Ascending and Numeric options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example shows a table in which this transformation will be applied to sort values in ascending alphabetic order using the '/ ' delimiter. As shown in the field with the ellipsis button, the transformation has been selected to apply to cells within the 'Engine Series' column. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Before the transformation is applied, the values in the Engine Series column (column 5) display in non-alphabetical order, e.g., AL / AJ / AG / AH / AM / AK / AU. </p>
        <p class="Image1"> <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/SortValsInCellsB4.png" /></p>

        <h3 class="RNOrange">New  'Remove duplicate values within cells' transformation</h3>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: RDPRT-3865</p>
        <p class="Body1">A new 'Remove duplicate values within cells' transformation has been introduced that removes duplicate values when they are contained within a single cell of a table.

        <p>This transformation is useful when consecutive rows in a table have been consolidated into one row. When this is done, the resultant row will often have cell entries of merged data that require some cleanup and/or consolidation.</p>
        <p>Duplicates are removed by specifying a value delimiter. For example, using the pipe character (|) as the delimiter, the string 'DC9|DC9|DC7|DC12|DC9|DC7' becomes 'DC9|DC7|DC12'. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-02-25T14:16:38.2440475-05:00" MadCap:creator="kihe" MadCap:initials="KI" MadCap:comment="Sentence added" MadCap:editor="kihe" MadCap:editDate="2019-02-25T14:16:40.8825360-05:00">If</MadCap:annotation> a hard return separates the entries in a cell, the delimiter of \n should be specified.</p>

        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: RDINT-8077. This one also isn't available when doing data import/export. </p>
        <p class="Body1">A new 'Range consolidation within cells' transformation has been introduced that consolidates ranges of data that might exist within a single cell of a table. Like the 'Sort values within cells' and 'Remove duplicate values within cells' transformations, this transformation is available as a selection in the following locations: </p>

            <li class="Bullet1"><b>Range Delimiter:</b> Users may enter one or more characters that denote the delimiter.

Example: 2007-2012 or 2012-2007 if a numerical range, and A-F or F-A for an alphabetic range.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following examples assume the value delimiter is the pipe character (|) and the range delimiter is a hyphen (-):</p>
