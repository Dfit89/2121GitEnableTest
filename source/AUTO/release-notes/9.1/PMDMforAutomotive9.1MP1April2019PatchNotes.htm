        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">Known Issue with the PAdb importer</p>
        <p class="Body3"> With this maintenance patch, there is a limitation where users may encounter a STACKTRACE error when importing the latest version of the PAdb files. This error  would be encountered only in a situation when the legacy PAdb LOVs are made to replace with new values during import and those LOVs are used in a PAdb attribute referenced to a Classification with an existing LOV filter. If there are no such filters set, the PAdb file will be imported without any errors. We suggest that users  refrain from importing the PAdb file in this release. We plan on releasing the next automotive 9.1 MP2 patch in May. If there is a fix for the PAdb importer prior to that release, then we will backport and create a hotfix for the automotive 9.1 MP1 release.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">STEP Automotive solution will hereafter be referred as PMDM for Automotive solution</p>

        <p class="Body3">Changed the way the ACES importer handles the applications when applications with invalid vehicle configurations are loaded in the system. Previously, importing an ACES file with applications holding invalid vehicle configurations was imported flawless without validating the conditions against vehicle configurations. Now, a new parameter called 'Check configuration validity' is available in the business condition 'Validate Application on import' which in turn is configured in the Import state of ACES Import workflow  as displayed in the screenshot below. This parameter provides an option to either allow or reject invalid applications. Selecting this parameter checkbox will fail the import when any application record with invalid vehicle configuration is present.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, if a delete flag (for example, attribute Delete Status = true) was set on an object, importing a file that does not contain that object would remove the delete flag even though the object is expected to still remain flagged as deleted. Now, when an object is marked for deletion, the delete value of 'true' on the delete attribute  remains as 'true' unless that object is resurrected in a later imported file.</p>
