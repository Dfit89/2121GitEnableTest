            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2420</MadCap:conditionalText>Fixed Application Condition Header - Group component to display newly added conditions with filtered values based on the validation path</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously in Application Editor, when a new condition is added in the condition editor, the list of values to select from would be empty. The Application Condition Header - Group component has been fixed so that when a new condition is added in the condition editor, values will be displayed to select from. The values are filtered based on the Automotive Validation Path that is configured on the condition attribute.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-1573</MadCap:conditionalText>Fixed Automotive Validation Path error handling in Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, if an attribute that is linked to a part type contains an invalid Automotive Validation Path, this would cause all condition attributes in the Application Editor to display all available options in the dropdown list instead of displaying only the valid filtered options. Also, there wasn't an indication to the user in the Application Editor that an error had been encountered with the validation path. This has been fixed so that if an attribute contains an invalid Automotive Validation Path, only the condition attribute with the invalid path will display all available options, other condition attributes will still retain the valid filtered options in the dropdown list. If the condition attribute with the invalid path is displayed in its own column, then a warning icon will be displayed and hovering over the icon will display a message indicating which reference or attribute contains the error. If the condition attribute with the invalid path is not displayed in its own column, then opening the value editor window will display the error message below the condition with the invalid path.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2404</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated easy setup functionality for NAPA and TecDoc so that existing objects are not re-set when easy setup is run repeatedly</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, if easy setup had been run and the objects created by the setup had been modified, running easy setup again would wipe out any manual changes that had been made and would re-set the object to the initial easy setup state. This was previously resolved for AutoCare and now has been resolved for NAPA and TecDoc so that easy setup does not modify existing objects unless the change is to expand on an existing definition (e.g., increase max attribute length or add an additional validation type).  Note that as part of this change, the option to modify initial configuration settings when running setup for the import processes has been removed. Previously running option 2 of the easy setup for NAPA or TecDoc would present the user with an interface to specify IDs of workflows, integration endpoints, etc. These user-specified options have been removed and all IDs are now included within the setup code.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2439</MadCap:conditionalText>Fixed PCdb Importer to handle N/A Position</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the 'N/A' value was not being added to AC_Position LOV through PCdb Importer, which would cause the Part Terminologies that have N/A as the only valid position to not have a proper filter and would allow all positions to be selected. PCdb Importer has been updated so that the N/A value is written to the AC_Position LOV and that the AC_ACESPosition attribute that is linked to the Part Terminology is filtered correctly to display only the valid position(s) for that Part Terminology to be selected.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2172</MadCap:conditionalText>Fixed NullPointerException error when attempting to delete missing applications in Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, attempting to delete missing applications in Application Editor would generate a NullPointerException error. This has been fixed so that the NullPointerException is no longer displayed. When attempting to delete missing applications, no action will be taken in the Application Editor because missing records can't be deleted since they don't exist.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2264</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated Application Condition Header - Group plugin in Application Editor to align value editor fields</p>
        <p class="Body3">For better visual display, Application Condition Header - Group plugin in Application Editor has been updated so that all value editor fields are now left-aligned properly and spacing has been added between the fields so that they don't overlap one another.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2087</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated easy setup to rename the ID and Name of Import Flow Group Type objects</p>
        <p class="Body3">The ID and Name of Import Flow Group Type controller group objects have been updated to be more consistent across standards. For example, STEP Name = 'Application data imports' has been changed to 'AutoCare ACES.' And STEP ID = 'application__Application data imports' has been changed to 'AC_ACESImport.'</p>
        <p class="Body3">For new implementations, running <b>Automotive - [Standard] Model &gt; 2. Configure [Standard] Import Process</b> easy setup will create new Inbound Integration Endpoints (IIEP) with the new ID and Name pattern. Once a file is imported, the Import Flow Group Type controller group objects will be created with the new ID and Name pattern.</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Existing implementations should make these changes manually in order see the new ID and Name pattern after files are imported:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullet3">In the Tree tab, delete the Import Flow Group Type objects below the Import Flow Root</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">In System Setup tab, edit the Inbound Integration Endpoints</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">In step 5.1 (Configure Processing Engine : Configuration) change the ID Prefix for each endpoint</li>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when a user enters vehicle options to create an application record and saves, the vehicle options would not be retained for the new application. Application  Editor has been updated so that when a user creates new application records with vehicle options that all populated options will be saved.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2265</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated 'Application Condition Header - Group' component in Application Editor to have a fixed height and vertical scroll bar</p>
        <p class="Body3">In the Application Editor screen, the 'Application Condition Header - Group' options value editor window has been updated with a fixed height and contains a vertical scroll bar if the data to be displayed is greater than the window size.</p>

        <p class="Body3">The PAdb importer has been updated to set the attribute validation base type to be 'Numeric Text' when there are multiple Metadata validation types for the same attribute. Previously, the validation base type was incorrectly set as 'List Of Values.'</p>

        <p class="Body3">Easy setup for TecDoc has been updated to make attributes TD_ATTR_BJvon and TD_ATTR_BJbis valid for Tractor Axle object type in order to fix some errors during TecDoc Reference data import. The updates can be applied by running <b>Automotive - TecDoc Model &gt; 1. Configure TecDoc Data Model</b> easy setup. Or existing implementations can make these changes manually:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullet3">Select the existing TD_ATTR_BJvon attribute and navigate to the [Validity] tab</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">Below the 'Valid for Classification Types' flipper, select the 'Tractor Axle' object type</li>

        <p class="Body3">Easy setup has been updated to make the ValidateApplication Business Condition Global and valid for application object types for each standard so that error handling for invalid part type or invalid vehicle is reported correctly. The update can be applied by running <b>Automotive - [Standard] Model &gt; 2. Configure [Standard] Import Process</b> easy setup. Existing implementations will need to delete the ValidateApplication Business Condition first before rerunning step 2 of easy setup in order to change the Business Condition to be Global.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously the Application Condition Header, Application Comment, and Application Asset Reference header popup windows in Application Editor were not resizeable, which would cause the windows to be cut off if the browser width or height was too small. The max height and width for these components have been adjusted to not exceed the browser height and width so that the windows will always be visible.</p>

        <p class="Body3">In order to stay consistent with PIES attribute grouping model, PIES Importer has been updated to create Price Sheet attribute groups with the name in the following format: <b>PIES Price Segment PRCS [Price Sheet Name from input file]</b> (e.g., 'PIES Price Segment PRCS 2017 WD Prices')</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2432</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated easy setup for TecDoc to add the name for two entity objects</p>
        <p class="Body3">Easy setup for TecDoc has been updated to add a name for entity objects TD_TecDocManufacturerRoot to be 'TecDoc Manufacturers' and TD_TecDocResourceRoot to be 'TecDoc Resources.' The updates can be applied by running <b>Automotive - TecDoc Model &gt; 1. Configure TecDoc Data Model</b> easy setup.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2459</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated Application Condition Header - Group component in Application Editor to default cursor to the first value field</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when a user first opens the dialog window for the condition editor, the cursor defaults to the field where a new condition is typed. The Application Condition Header - Group component has been updated so that the cursor is defaulted to the first value field. This has been fixed when the condition editor window only contains single value attributes. If there is a multi-valued attribute, the cursor will default to the multi-valued attribute instead. The fix for multi-valued attributes will come in future releases.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2462</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated Application Condition Header - Individual component in Application Editor be displayed in alphabetical order if Display Sequence is not populated</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, if multiple conditions are added for individual column display in the Application Editor, they would be displayed in random order if the Display Sequence attribute is not populated. The Application Condition Header - Individual component has been updated so if the Display Sequence is not populated for any of the individual conditions, then the individual conditions will be displayed in alphabetical order. If some individual conditions have Display Sequence populated and some do not, then the conditions with the Display Sequence populated will be handled first in the order of the Display Sequence number. Then the conditions without Display Sequence populated are handled next and displayed in alphabetical order.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2440</MadCap:conditionalText>Changed LOV filtering for ACES Position attribute to display only the valid values that are filtered on the part type that the application is referenced to</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, if an application object is referenced to a part type and the PIES item is referenced to a different part type, then the Position list of values to select from would contain values from both the part type referenced by the PIES item and the part type referenced by the application object. The LOV filtering on the ACES Position attribute has been changed so that applications with a part type that differs from the part type of the PIES item will no longer have the position attribute filtered on the PIES items part type. It would only contain the filtered values from the part type referenced by the applications.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note:  RDCUST-2460</MadCap:conditionalText>Updated the Delta file creation in the importflow to create a delete file with only objects that has an object type that is valid for the DeleteStatus attribute</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously when importing a file, the Delta Calculation state would generate errors if the change flag attributes was not made valid for all object types. The Delta Calculation has been updated so that it will no longer create delete file entries for objects that the DeleteStatus attribute is not valid for.</p>
