            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST- 3099 </MadCap:conditionalText>New component names for Application Manager specific Action buttons</p>
        <p class="Body3">With the release of Automotive 8.3 MP1, two new Action button components were added for use with the restricted node list within the Application Manager. Because these components were copied from the STEP core Action button components 'Export Action' and 'Create Collection Action,' they were given the same component name and description. This posed a problem as users were not able to decipher which listing of the component would work with the Application Manager. If the STEP core Action button components were added to an Application Manager then errors would occur. Now, the Action button names  are updated to  'Export Action Automotive' and 'Create Collection Action Automotive,' and their descriptions clearly communicate they are to be used within the Application Manager Screen. </p>

        <p class="Body3">The Application Manager screen is now updated with a 'Clear All' link that, when clicked, will reset or clear all  search criteria, as well as any displayed search results. Previously, a 'Clear Criteria' link was provided that, when clicked, would clear only the criteria fields, and not the displayed results. This link has been replaced with the 'Clear All' link.</p>

This meant that the next time a search was run, the Results Table would display the filtered search results.

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the Application Manager screen did not provide a 'Title' parameter. This posed a problem for those using more than one Application Manager screen, as they could not easily determine which Application Manager screen they were currently using. Now, a 'Title' parameter is available on the Application Manager Screen component, allowing for Web UI Designer users to customize the title of each Application Manager screen. In the example below, the Application Manager configured for the TecDoc solution via Easy Setup actions is displayed with the Title parameter populated as 'TecDoc Application Manager.'</p>

A populated cell value within the column was double clicked, and the  'Application Competitor or OE Part Numbers' Table Header component dialog displays with the label 'Competitor or OEM Applications.' Within the dialog, the current application number '351080051' displays along with four interchangeable part numbers and their values for the valid attributes (ACES Drive Type, ACES Mfr Body Code, ACES&#160;Region).</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when a user selected a Vehicle type icon, the dropdown selections for the 'Existing and Missing Applications' and 'Hierarchy Restriction' dropdowns would remain. This has now been improved so that each time a different Vehicle type icon is selected, the two dropdowns reset to their respective defaults ('Existing Applications Only' and 'All Brands').</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the Application Set Part and Application Set Assembly header components (used within the Application Manager) would use a link icon instead of hyperlinked text. Clicking the link icon would navigate users to the Application Editor Part screen. Clicking the text did nothing. Now, when the 'Enable Link' parameter is enabled, the link icon no longer displays and clicking the text within the cell opens the Application Editor Part screen. When the Enable Link parameter is disabled, the link icon no longer displays and the text within the cell does not display as hyperlinked. This option is useful when linking to the Application Editor Part screen is not necessary.</p>
        <p class="Body3">In the example below, the 'Enable Link' parameter configuration within the 'Application Set Assembly' component is displayed above the 'Before change:' (displaying the link icon) and 'After change:' (displaying the hyperlinked text) Web UI display examples.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the   'Export Action Automotive' Action button and clicking the 'Start export' button within the Export dialog, a 'Failed asynchronous call' error message would display. This error message stopped users from being able to successfully export data. Now, this is corrected so that users are able to successfully export data from the Application Manager Results table.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, Easy Setup created the following Part Type object types with the Reference Target Lock Policy property set to 'Strict:' AC_PartTerminology, NAPA_MPCC, TD_StandardAssemblyGA, and TD_UniversalAssemblyGA. This could potentially cause locking errors on Reference Target objects when multiple imports were run in parallel. Now, Easy Setup has been updated so that the Part Type object types are created with the Reference Target Lock Policy property set to 'Relaxed.'</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Existing Implementations:</b> Run step 1 of Easy Setup for each standard and, in a matter of seconds, the necessary object type(s) will be updated to have the 'Relaxed' setting. This option is ideal because it does not put the system into single update mode. Otherwise the changes can be made by manually updating the Reference Target Lock Policy property value to 'Relaxed.' However, this manual action puts the system into Single Update Mode. Thus, it is suggested to make this manual change outside of business hours as to not impact performance, nor interfere with other users' work.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when importing an XML file containing special characters (i.e., &amp;, ', "), the automotive importer would convert the special characters in a way that would add more characters to the text. This caused the import to fail validation when character count restrictions were applied. This is now fixed,  so that the special characters are not mishandled, the character count validation does not fail, and the import can proceed as expected.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the bulk update function within the Application Manager, the node picker icon would not display. Thus, users could not select the desired node(s) for bulk update. Now, the node picker icon is properly displayed, so that the bulk update function can be used within the Application Manager.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when a user clicked the Application Manager Bulk Update action button and then needed to use the Node picker to select a necessary target vehicle, many of the vehicle Names displayed in a way that the user could not properly make their selection (i.e., shortened names, no ID).  Now, the Bulk Update Node picker displays the vehicle Name appended with the vehicle ID, and does not cut off the ID. If the Name appended with the ID is too long, then '...' will display between the Name and the ID. However, the entire ID is displayed, and only a portion of the Name is not displayed.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when multiple values were added to a Make/Model search box and the browser zoom was set below 100%, the value tiles would display double the usual height. This is now improved so that the value tile display height does not change, regardless of the browser zoom settings. In the screenshot below on the left, the value tiles are displayed using double height, whereas on the right, the same values tiles are displayed using the normal height.</p>

        <p class="Body3">With the Automotive 9.0 release, the Make/Model search box within the Application Manager was updated to require a value prior to allowing a search to be run. This posed an issue for those needing to search by an option like 'Engine Code' across multiple makes and/or models because the same engine can be available across several manufacturers. Now, this is corrected so that a value is no longer required within the Make/Model search box. However, when users attempt to run a search without populating the Make/Model search box, a dialog will display warning the user that the search may be time consuming, and suggesting the Report button option. Below is an example of the warning dialog.</p>

This forced users to update the cell values one at a time. Now, this is corrected, so that users can multi-select cells and edit the contents all at once. However, selected cells must have an existing value that is different from the updated value, or no changes will be made to any of the selected cells. </p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when the Application Manger was used to display missing applications, and a user selected those applications prior to clicking the 'Create Collection' action button, an error message would display within the BGP. Though existing applications were selected, and therefore expected to be within the newly created collection, the error message would inform the user that the 'File contains 0 rows'. Now, this is corrected so that users can use the 'Select All' button when both existing and missing applications are displayed, along with the 'Create Collection' button, and the existing applications will be successfully added to the collection. Though missing applications can be selected, they cannot be added to a collection because they do not actually exist in STEP.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, Qualifier parameters were not checked as part of the uniqueness when generating the ID for ACES applications. This caused applications with unique Qdb parameter values to not be properly imported because the Conversion state in the AutoCare ACES Import workflow did not read into the XML children of the &lt;Qual&gt; tag during the conversion state of the import workflow. Because the importer was not reading into the XML children of the tag, the data was thought to be duplicate, and was being skipped. Now, Qualifier parameters are part of the uniqueness check, the importer is correctly reading into the XML children, and the imports are able to be successfully processed. However, this correction requires existing applications with qualifier parameters to be assigned a new STEP ID when the next ACES&#160;import is completed.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using a Supplier Data importer, validation would fail and trigger warning messages when the VPE field was blank. This occurred because the VPE field had been incorrectly specified as mandatory. This was misconstrued because the field is mandatory when the MengeProVPE field is populated. Now, the code has been updated to handle the VPE field correctly.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the Supplier Data Importer, the status file would only be stored when the importer failed. This caused an issue with subsequent Supplier Data imports not benefiting from the delta calculation process. Now, whether the Supplier Data import fails or succeeds, the import file is properly saved.

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when the Application Competitor or OE Part Numbers component was used within the TecDoc Application Manager to create applications, the applicated numbers were not being stored below the value provided within the Object Type parameter of the component. This also caused for the applicated numbers not to display within the Application Manager results table. Now, this is resolved so that the applicated numbers are stored below the specified Object Type parameter, and properly display within the results table.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when  importing a TAF file an Out of Memory Exception error could occur, which was  caused by the tables being loaded into memory instead of being partially read. This is now resolved so that the tables are properly processed, and the error does not occur.</p>
