            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST- 3674</MadCap:conditionalText>New 'Mapper Action' button  to execute Mapper Configuration  setup entity</p>
        <p class="Body3">A new 'Mapper Action'  button has been added for configuration on the Source object screen to start a Mapper Configuration  setup entity. Previously, the 'Initiate Business Action' button was used to execute a Mapper Configuration setup entity from the Source object. The unique features of this action button include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">A required parameter called 'Mapper Configuration' that allows the user to directly configure the Mapper Configuration setup entity in the action button.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">The 'Run Before Action' parameter that allow users to configure a business action. The configured business action gets executed before the  Mapper Configuration setup entity is executed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Image3">

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">A status message dialog that will display when the user clicks on the action button. This dialog shows the execution status of the Mapper Configuration and configured business action execution in the top center of the screen. More details on the status of the execution can be seen either by clicking 'Click for details' link in the message dialog or by accessing through the Corner Bar Warning Notifications icon (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/WebUserInterfaces/MAIN/WarningIcon1.png" />). </li>

        <p class="Body3">Two new buttons to enable / disable the Mapping plugin is available within the Mappings tab of the Onboarding Mappings Details screen.

        <p class="Body3">'Application Comment' is a table header component that can be configured within the Application Manager results table using a Node List component to display comments. Previously, this table header component was available to be configured only in the Application Manager screen. Now, this table header component is also available in the Application Editor Screen (Parts) / (Vehicles). Users can configure the component in the Application Editor Screen (Parts) / (Vehicles) &gt; Node List &gt; Multi Edit Display Mode &gt; Headers parameter.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, step 1 of AutoCare Easy Setup created all of the PIES Extended Product Information (EXPI) (AC_PIESExtendedProductInfoSegmentEXPI) attributes as either Text or Numeric Text validation. But since PIES attribute data was moved to be Coded Values provided within the PCdb file, the attributes that were getting created by Easy Setup would never get updated.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Now, AutoCare Easy Setup has been updated to only create the AC_PIESExtendedProductInfoSegmentEXPI root attribute group. And PCdb importer has been updated to create all of the attribute groups and attributes, including List Of Values for the attributes that should have LOV validation.</p>
        <p class="Body3"> The newly created attributes reside within the following attribute groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">Core Returns</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">Hazardous Material</li>

        <p class="Body3">'On Target,' 'Child,' and 'Reference' are the options that can be populated within the 'Mapping type' parameter. The 'Reference Type' parameter is used only when the 'Reference' option is selected within the 'Mapping type' parameter. This parameter allows the user to select the reference type that should be used to establish the reference between the Target object and the newly created objects. Previously, when a reference type was defined within the 'Reference Type' parameter with the 'Reference' option populated in the 'Mapping type' parameter, if the 'Mapping type' is then changed to 'Child' option, then executing the Mapping plugin would still try use the specified Reference Type to create inactive references. This would throw a Mapping Error indicating that it failed to create the references. Now, this issue is resolved to not create any inactive references.</p>

        <p class="Body3"> Based on the table headers configured in the Application Manager screen, the search result displays many information (Parts, Vehicles, etc.) of the application which are in the form of hyperlinks. Clicking on the hyperlink would leave the Application Manager screen and navigate into another defined screen. Previously, when the user navigates to another screen by clicking on the hyperlink and then returns to the screen by clicking on the Back navigation button of the browser, the Application Manager screen was not holding the exact previous state of the search cards in the screen. Now, the Application Manager screen is updated to remember the state of the search cards so that the user can navigate back to the Application Manager from other screens with the previous state of the search cards retained.</p>

        <p class="Body3">On May 31st, 2019, AutoCare introduced six new Vehicle Type Groups and 114 new Vehicle Types in its complete VCdb file. The May month complete VCdb file did not contain any Make / Model / Year for the new Vehicle Types, so when importing the complete VCdb file, it would create a lot of empty vehicle type folders with no vehicle objects. The issue is fixed to not create any vehicle type objects if the vehicle types do not contain any Makes.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Users will not encounter this problem if the individual Light Duty VCdb files are imported, this is because the new Vehicle Type Groups are not included in the Light Duty VCdb file. And these new Vehicle Type Groups are removed from the June complete VCdb file by AutoCare.</p>
