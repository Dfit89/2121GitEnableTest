            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-3054</MadCap:conditionalText>Added option to exclude certain attributes and / or references from the PIES Export</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the 'AutoCare PIES Exporter' format was hard-coded to include all attributes / attribute groups related to the PIES Item in the PIES exported file, which prevented users from selecting attributes from the PIES Item to be included / excluded in the exported file. The PIES Exporter has now been updated to include a new parameter 'Exclude Attribute Group' to allow users to select the attribute groups to be excluded in the exported file. The 'Exclude Attribute Group' parameter is available within the 'Advanced' tab of the Export Manager. The parameter allows users to select attribute groups that can be excluded from being exported. If no attribute group(s) is defined in the parameter, the export continues to function as before and no attribute groups will be excluded from export. </p>
        <p class="Body3">This parameter is available in all the versions of the PIES export. To add the attributes / references in the exclusion list, users will need to manually create a new attribute group and link attributes and / or references to that attribute group that they want to exclude from the PIES export before defining that attribute group in the 'Exclude Attribute Group' parameter.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Following are the features of this parameter: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">The new parameter allows multi attribute group selection. If more than one attribute group need to be excluded from the export, users can define more than one attribute group in the parameter.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">This new functionality also handles references that are added to the attribute group. If a reference is added to the attribute group that is selected to be excluded, then the attributes and references that are in the selected attribute group are excluded from the PIES export.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">It also handles data containers. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body3">At present, following are the limitations of this parameter that will be implemented in a future release:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3">Excluding PIES Asset references is currently not supported. </li>
            <li class="Bullet3">This new feature DOES NOT support excluding specific Description Type within Data Containers or specific Asset Types within PIES Asset references. For example, If the user wants to only export Features and Benefits and Label Description types, but exclude all other Description types, then the user will not be able to do that. </li>
            <li class="Bullet3">If the user wants to specify that certain Asset Types such as Primary Photo (P04) and User Defined (ZZ1-ZZ9) should be exported, but exclude all other Asset Types, then the user will not be able to do that either. This will be implemented in a future release.</li>
        </ul>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-3816</MadCap:conditionalText>New config property Automotive.Aces.IgnoreSupplier to ignore the supplier information populated in the Replacement Context attribute during the ACES file import</p>
        <p class="Body3">To improve the performance of the Delta Calculation in the ACES Importer, the 'context' method of the Delta calculation can now be configured to ignore the supplier information populated in the Replacement Context attribute during the ACES import. There is a new config property, <b>Automotive.Aces.IgnoreSupplier</b>, which is set to false by default to always check the supplier information (meaning it will include to populate the supplier information along with other information in the Replacement Context attribute). If it is set to true, then the supplier information is not checked in the ACES file import and the attribute called Replacement Context (AC_ACESReplacementContext) will have a value populated that ignores the supplier information. In the example below, 'ACES-Supplier0934-DKGX-30489-5696-JK36004' is the attribute value populated in the Replacement Context attribute that includes 'Supplier0934' as the supplier information. If the config property <b>Automotive.Aces.IgnoreSupplier</b> is set to true, then the import of ACES file will populate the Replacement Context attribute by value 'ACES-DKGX-30489-5696-JK36004' (meaning, it will not populate the supplier information 'Supplier0934-' in the Replacement Context attribute).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body3">This solution is also available for STEP-8.2-mp3 via a hotfix.</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Hotfix recipe compatible with STEP 8.2 MP3 + Automotive 8.2 MP4: </b><span class="commandfont">to:hotfix/374/issue-374695-HOTFIX-3488.spr</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Existing Implementations:</b> For this change to take effect, after applying the hotfix, the user must do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered2">Add the new property to sharedconfig.properties file:  Automotive.Aces.IgnoreSupplier=true</li>
            <li class="Numbered2">Update the AC_ACESReplacementContext attribute value in all existing applications to have the supplier information  removed from the value. This can be done by creating a JavaScript action with JavaScript such as: </li>
        </ol><pre xml:space="preserve" class="PreIndent">var split = currentContext.split("-");
if (split.length != 6) {
	//throw some errors ....
}
var res = split[0]+"-"+split[2]+"-"+split[3]+"-"+split[4]+"-"+split[5];
node.setSimpleValue(contextAttr,res);</pre>
        <p xml:space="preserve" class="Body3">
The above JavaScript uses the following three binds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet4">node = current object</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">currentContext = attribute value (AC_ACESReplacementContext)</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">contextAttr = attribute (AC_ACESReplacementContext)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body3">Additionally, also consider whether to set the import delta context to work on Brand or Part Terminology. For example, if you know that a supplier will always provide all applications for a Brand, then the system can be configured so it does not look up individual parts. Or if you know a supplier will send all applications for a Part Terminology at a time, then the system can be configured so that it only looks at the Brand + Part Terminology.</p>
        <p class="Body3">This can be configured globally through the ACES import workflow, or per Brand. For more information, see topic <b>9.

        <p class="Body3">The existing solution of the ACES Exporter is to only include the application note information that is directly referenced by the ACES application record. There are some special cases where the application notes are linked to the parent of the application records and are inherited by the application records. Now, the ACES Exporter is updated to also include the inherited application note information in the exported ACES file. To include the inherited application note information, the user has to manually add the Valid Source Types to the AC_ACESApplicationToApplicationNote product reference that the user wants the Application Note reference to inherit from. Also, for the Application Note product reference, users should change the 'Inheritance' parameter to be either 'Inherited' or 'Accumulative' depending on what the user wants to get exported.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the Faceted Search screen had a problem with displaying the correct count of  search results. Any search results exceeding 200 counts would list all the search results but would not show the correct count displayed in the bottom left of the screen. Now, the Faceted Search screen is corrected to display correct number of search counts. The default value that is set to display for the search count is 1000. If this number needs to be increased, it can be changed in sharedconfig property <b>Onboarding.FacetedSearchDialogServerComponent.FindMax</b> </p>

        <p class="Body3">Checking the parameter 'Swap User' available within the File Loading Widget Properties runs the file import as the logged in user instead of the IIEP user. Previously, this parameter had no significance in the Automotive import framework because the Automotive import workflows always used the user from the IIEP for the controller entities. Now, this issue is fixed so that the automotive import workflows are able to retrieve the user ID that is importing the file and have that user ID to be associated with the controller entity instead of the user from the IIEP so that tasks within the import workflow states are correctly associated with the user ID that dropped the file into the File Loading Widget. The user ID is now stored on the import controller object in a new attribute called Overwriting User. If the ID of the user that is importing the file (Ready for Import state) should be used instead of the user who dropped the file into the File Loading Widget, this can be done by a business action to update the user ID to the one of the current user just before the import is started.</p>
