        <p class="Body2">This document is intended for use by active PMDM for Automotive users and serves to describe the new and enhanced features provided by the release. It does not serve as a replacement for the STEP Online Help nor the Automotive Quick Start Guide and Automotive Reference Guide, which include additional information on previously existing system functionality, as well as more detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions for use, when applicable.</p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p class="Body2">This document describes the changes between the current and previous release. </p>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Some functionality is controlled via component activation, which may include licenses and/or component installations, and may not be available on a particular system.

        <h2 class="MPNDocumentation">Announcement</h2>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">Application Editor (Application Search Screen) deprecated / withdrawn</p>
        <p class="Body3">To improve overall functionality and the user experience when editing, viewing, and/or managing applications, the 'Application Manager Screen' has been created to replace the functionality previously offered by the automotive tool known as the 'Application Editor.' The tool was created using the 'Application Search Screen' component. Now, the 'Application Search Screen' has been deprecated / withdrawn, and is no longer supported. Instead, please use the 'Application Manager Screen.' Additionally, it is important to note that a separate component 'Application Editor Screen' does exist and is used to view and edit part and assembly applications. </p>
        <p class="Body3">For more information, see the new <b>Application Manager</b> section of the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b> found within the <b>Solution Enablement</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Application Manager/Application Manager.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Additionally, customers should read the Release Notes for STEP 9.0, the June (MP1) and July (MP2) Maintenance Patch Notes, as well as the Platform and Software Support Changes release note for additional information<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Release Notes/Release Notes for 9.0/Release Notes for STEP 9.0.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p class="Body3">With every STEP&#160;release, typically some STEP&#160;components get deprecated, removed, or desupported for various reasons. Anything with a user impact has been called out in the applicable release note and may require special attention and user action before upgrading to STEP&#160;9.0 MP2.</p>
        <h2 class="MPNNewFeatures">New Features</h2>
        <p class="Body3"> Stibo Systems has enhanced the PMDM for Automotive solution in a number of areas:</p>
        <h3>All Standards</h3>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU PRODOC- 1395 </MadCap:conditionalText>New Competitor and OE Numbers Solution</p>
        <p class="Body3">The automotive functionality now includes a competitor and OE numbers solution that makes it easy to maintain data related to both competitor and OE&#160;part numbers. This not only helps users more easily view, edit, and create competitor and/or OE part number references for specific parts, but also suggest potential matches. In other words, when configured, STEP can suggest potential matches for competitor and/or OE part numbers based on existing competitor and/or OE part number references and/or matching part numbers within STEP. This occurs when a part is selected, STEP looks at the configured Reference Types and displays their targets, attribute values, and/or metadata.</p>

        <p class="Body3">To improve users' ability to find and view ACES conditions / attributes, the default attribute names are no longer prefixed with 'ACES.' When Easy Setup actions are used for new environments, the attributes' names will no longer be prefixed with 'ACES.' </p>
        <p class="Body3">In the example below, the AutoCare ACES attributes are displayed in System Setup before and after this change. On the left, the 'ACES Body Num Doors' attribute name is selected, and on the right, the same attribute is selected, but displays as 'Body Num Doors.'</p>

        <p class="Body3">To reduce the amount of unused TecDoc data being imported, a new parameter (Omit search structures) has been added to the TecDoc Reference Importer. Previously, all Search Trees were imported, and now these can all be omitted. The parameter is available as a checkbox when editing the 'TecDoc Reference Import Conversion' Business Rule within the TecDoc Reference import workflow. The parameter is displayed in the second screenshot below.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RD-11468 </MadCap:conditionalText>Import only the generic articles needed</p>
        <p class="Body3">To reduce the amount of unnecessary TecDoc generic articles being imported into STEP, the TAF conversion service now includes a new filter parameter (Generic article filter). Previously, all of the generic articles had to be imported, and now only those selected within the filter are imported. The parameter is available when editing the 'TecDoc Reference Import Conversion' Business Rule. </p>
        <p class="Body3">In the example below, the 0003 Product Hierarchy is shown including many Articles, the editing of the 'TecDoc Reference Import Conversion' Business Rule is displaying the 'Generic article filter' parameter with the 'Air Mass Sensor' and 'Glow Plug' generic articles selected for import, and the results are the 0003 Product Hierarchy is shown with only the 'Air Mass Sensor' and 'Glow Plug' articles.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="font-weight: normal;">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2969 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected exception handling when running multiple import threads</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the  'Set Import Status Attributes' business action had exception handling that erroneously caused the importer to fail in some scenarios where import threads were run in parallel. Users experienced an error message of : 'Transaction already marked for rollback only.' Now, the exception handling has been corrected, and the importer should not erroneously display this error.  </p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note"><span style="font-weight: normal;">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2943</span> </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected line break display when using the Application Set Assembly component within an Application Manager</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when multiple attributes were added to the Attribute List parameter in the Application Set Assembly header component used within the Application Manager, the attribute names and values were displayed in the results table without any line breaks. Now, the attribute name is displayed in bold, the non-bold attribute value follows, and each new attribute is displayed on a new line.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="font-weight: normal;">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2949 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected the display of the Create Application button when 'Lazy' loading is enabled on a Sub Screen Tab Page</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when the 'Lazy' loading parameter was enabled on a Sub Screen Tab Page that was used to display an Application Editor Screen, the Create Application action button would no longer display. This has been corrected so that the Create Application button displays whether or not the 'Lazy' parameter is enabled.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="font-weight: normal;">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2768 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected the way the VCdb importer handles model IDs</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the VCdb importer would create the Model ID based on the Model Name value, and did not consider the Make. This is an issue for those Model Names that occur across multiple makes, because it results in those Models being referenced to the wrong Make classification folder.</p>
        <p class="Body3">For example, the 200 model is offered by many different manufacturers (i.e., Audi, Chrysler, Griffith, Mercedes-Benz, Packard). Upon import, the Audi 200 would be created as a child classification folder beneath the Audi classification folder (since it was the first make with the 200 model listed within the import). Then when the Chrysler 200 was processed, it would erroneously be added to the Audi 200 classification folder.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Now, the importer considers the Make in the Model ID structure, and the Model Names that occur across multiple makes are properly created within their own Make classification folder.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Though this fix was implemented for 8.3 MP1, it has also been backported to STEP 8.2 MP3 + Automotive 8.2 MP4. The recipe to patch with 8.2 MP3 is: <span class="commandfont">to:hotfix/317/issue-317137-HOTFIX-2540.spr</span></p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, the TD_LOV-DocumentType values were created when the Easy Setup actions are completed, but the Reference data importer was not reading and updating the values upon import. Now, the Reference Data importer reads and updates STEP with the TD_LOV-DocumentType values from TAF table 014. </p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2954 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected an exception that was thrown when using an Application Manager component without TecDoc Reference data privileges</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, an exception error would display when a user without TecDoc Reference data privileges used an Application Manager Condition Header Component within Web UI. Now, this is resolved so that users do not experience an error message.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2985</MadCap:conditionalText> Correct Country group ID created</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, during the conversion state errors would occur because the correct country group ID was not created. Now, Easy setup actions will create the correct Country group ID (TD_CountryGroup) and add it as a valid target type for 'TD_SupplierArticleToCountry' classification reference.</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Existing Implementations</b>: Manually add the 'TD_CountryGroup' as the valid target type for the  'TD_SupplierArticleToCountry' classification reference. </p>
        <h2 class="MPNDocumentation">Documentation Updates</h2>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">Improve Application Manager search accuracy with automotive plugins</p>
        <p class="Body3">A new section of documentation has been added to help users improve search accuracy when using the Application Manager. When a business condition is configured with the 'Check path for missing attribute' plugin, search result accuracy can be improved for specific part types. This is accomplished by allowing the data model to include a relationship between conditions on applications and different vehicle configurations. This can be helpful when specific part types do not apply to certain vehicle configurations. Additionally, it allows the Web UI Application Manager to search for applications with conditions for all sub models. For more information, see the <b>Business Condition: Check Path for Missing Application</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Business Rules/Business Condition Check Path for Missing Application.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref> within the <b>Business Rules</b> section of the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b> found within the <b>Solution Enablement</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b>.</p>

        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">Automotive guides no longer include Application Editor section</p>
        <p class="Body3">Now that the  Application Search Screen (also known as 'Application Editor' ) is no longer supported, the 'Application Editor' section has been removed from all Automotive documentation.
