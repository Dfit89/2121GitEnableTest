            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: PDO-2536 </MadCap:conditionalText>Enhancements to Application Record Generation for Print Tables</p>
        <p class="Body3">New functionality simplifies the extraction of Application Records and population of table(s) when the Vehicle Table structure is simple (e.g., a Make / Model / Year construction). The previous functionality that allows the use of Product Nodes is still available for complex and some non-standard 'Vehicle Table' classification structures. In addition, the enhancements will allow unwanted Application Records (and there may be many) to be ignored and filtered out of the table so that complex transformations to get rid of them do not have to be deployed.</p>
        <p class="Body3">The system will recognize whether the currently selected node is a Product Node or a Classification Node and will populate the table with Application Records. Three mandatory Description Attributes must reside on the Publication. The Description attributes are PRINT_AppToAssyReferenceTypeID, PRINT_AssemblyYearObjectTypeID,  and PRINT_PartTypeLinkReferenceTypeID.</p>
        <p class="Body3">When iterating through the classification folders to locate the Object Types that match the entry in PRINT_AssemblyYearObjectTypeID attributes, there may be many valid Object Types that are not required for Print purposes. It is desirable not to scan down these unwanted Nodes and thus not populate the table with Application Records that will never be used in Print. An optional Description attribute on the Classification Node will define whether to include or exclude that folder structure in the extraction of Application Records. A value of 'N' will exclude that folder structure. A null value or a value of Y will include the folder structure. This new filtering Description attribute is called 'PRINT_IncludeClassificationNode.'</p>
        <p class="Body3">When a product node is currently selected, the existing functionality looks for a reference of the reference type = PrintMakeToVehicleMake. But, after analysis, the only real function of this reference was to identify the currently selected product node as being a vehicle 'Make.' In order to avoid the necessity of having to generate 'dummy' references to classification nodes, the new solution will be to place a Description attribute on the Publication that identifies which Object Type in the Print Structure is a vehicle 'Make.'  That removes the need for all former PrintMakeToVehicleMake references. The new Description attribute is called PRINT_StructureMakeID.</p>

            </MadCap:conditionalText>Once an Automotive add-on is installed to a base STEP system, the base system cannot be upgraded without upgrading the Automotive add-on at the same time. Additionally, when upgrading any base STEP system that has any Automotive add-on installed, both install recipes must be prepared at the same time.  </p>
