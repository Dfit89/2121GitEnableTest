        <p class="Body3">Within the automotive industry, it is vital to properly maintain  parts data pertaining to country inclusion and/or exclusion to ensure market specific coverage and legal compliance. The Country Handling solution helps users view, edit, and create  accurate country handling inclusion and exclusion references for specific parts and applications. This Web UI solution also prevents users from  creating conflicting inclusion and/or exclusion relationships.</p>
        <p class="Body3">The Country Handling solution can be used within an Application Manager Results Table via an 'Application Country Handling Table Header' component and within a Node Editor screen via 'Country Handling Value' component. For more information, see the <b>Country Handling Solution</b> section of <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b><MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Country Handling/Country Handling Solution.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body3">In the screenshot below, the 'Application Country Handling Table Header' component is displayed with the default column heading (Countries) within an Application Manager Results Table.</p>

This makes it easier for users to identify their own part information within the list of competitor and/or OE part numbers. </p>
        <p class="Body3">In the screenshot below, the Stibo Systems' logo displays as an example for a customer's own logo.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when adding Tab Pages to a Node Picker Dialog for an Application Set Assembly component within the Application Manager Results Table, the Add Component dialog did not display. This made it impossible to complete the necessary configuration of the component. Now, this is corrected, and the component can be properly configured for use.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when more than one 'Application Competitor or OE Part Numbers' component was configured within an Application Manager Results Table, only the results from the right most component would display within all iterations of the component. Now, this is corrected so that more than one 'Application Competitor or OE Part Numbers' component can be configured within an Application Manager Results Table and display the expected results based upon the configurations.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when the 'Application Competitor or OE Part Numbers' component was configured within an Application Manager Results Table, and a user double clicked to open the dialog, and an OK button displayed in the bottom right. This OK button resulted in a lot of unnecessary white space and was not needed since the dialog also included an 'X' in the upper right corner that, when clicked, closes the dialog (the same functionality the OK button offered). Now, the OK button has been removed allowing for the display to be filled with more usable information and less wasteful white space.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the Application Manager search boxes, if a user placed the cursor into the typeahead field at the bottom of the box more than once, the dropdown list would not display. Now, this has been corrected so that any time the cursor is placed into the typeahead field at the bottom of a search box, the valid dropdown selections will display. </p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the Application Manager to search for Make/Model criteria, running the search, and then adding additional criteria within the Make/Model search box, the search would be interrupted. Now, this is corrected so that users can make changes to the search box criteria, after running a search, and the desired results will display. </p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when editing values within an Application Manager Results Table, and clicking the Reset button, all of the results within the table would disappear. Now, this has been fixed so that when the Reset button is clicked, only the changes made within the Results table are cleared or reverted back to the original values displayed when the search was run.</p>
        <p class="Body3">In the screenshot below, the Reset button displays as active because changes have been made to the Supplier Article cell.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, users were not able to select valid parts when attempting to create applications for certain vehicle types within an Application Editor screen. Now, any vehicle object type that is defined as a valid target in the application reference type can be used to select a valid part when creating an application through the Application Editor screen using Data Provider = Assembly Application.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, it was possible to configure the 'Application Set Part' header component in a way that would cause an error message to display for users. Now, if a user attempts to save this component without the Attribute parameter populated, an 'INVALID (Headers)' and a warning message will display indicating that the screen cannot be saved while one or more components has configuration errors.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST- 3130 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected ID Header component handling of screen mapping</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when an ID Header component was configured with the 'Enable Link' parameter enabled, and a user clicked on the link, an error message would display notifying the user that the screen trying to load was invalid. This occurred despite the proper configuration of screen mappings. Now, this is corrected so that when a screen with the ID 'productdetails' exists, and a user clicks the ID&#160;Header component link, then the default productdetails screen displays. Additionally, when screen mapping for the selected object is configured, and a user clicks the ID Header component link, then the user will be directed to the screen ID mapped for that Object Type. However, if the default productdetails screen ID does not exist, and no additional screen mapping is configured for the specific Object Type being clicked, then the following error message will display: "The configuration for the screen you are trying to load is invalid and the screen cannot be displayed: No screen with ID [productdetails]"</p>
        <p class="Body3">In the screenshot below, a Part Number Reference component is configured to include an ID Header component with the Enable Link parameter enabled. In the background, the linked Object Type (AC_PIESInterchangeItem_e211) displays along with the error message that will only display when the default 'productdetails' screen ID is not created or the screen mappings are not properly configured for the selected Object Type. </p>

        <p class="Body3">Previously, when configuring the PIES 6.5 exporter 'Part Number Source' parameter with an attribute other than the default 'AC_PIES_ITEMPartNumber,' the attribute was not retained when saving the export configuration. Therefore, when the saved export configuration was used, the expected results were not displayed in the exported file for the Part Number. Now, the saved export configuration retains the attribute selection in the 'Part Number Source' parameter so that the expected results are displayed.</p>
