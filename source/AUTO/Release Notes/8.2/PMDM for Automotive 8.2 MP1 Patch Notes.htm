        <h2 class="MPNNewFeatures">New Features</h2>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2206, 2209</MadCap:conditionalText>Added support for explicit deletions in ACES Importer</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, deletions were only supported via complete replacement scenarios (SubmissionType=FULL). Now, deletions can also be carried out using an explicit delete (action=D) when a standard update file (SubmissionType=UPDATE) is supplied.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2159, 2165, 2162, 2163</MadCap:conditionalText>Added support for recent format changes in AutoCare reference data</p>
        <p class="Body3">Beginning in April 2017, AutoCare released some minor format changes in the reference data files (PCdb, PAdb, VCdb, Qdb, and Brand). The corresponding importers have been updated to support these changes. A complete list of changes is available upon request, but is not listed in these notes as all changes were insignificant. For example, the PCdb Category.txt file is now called Categories.txt, and the order of columns in the Codemaster.txt file was changed. </p>
        <h2 class="MPNBugFix">Bugfixes</h2>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-1998, 2105</MadCap:conditionalText>Added Javadoc for import flow</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the import flow package was included in the Extension API, but the Javadoc was not available for it. This has been added and all documentation can be found in the Extension API Javadoc for the com.stibo.importflow.domain.extension package.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2207</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected handling of unidentified Supplier in ACES Importer</p>
        <p class="Body3">Updated ACES Importer to error during conversion if the brand(s) in the input file are identified as needing to take Supplier into consideration and Supplier cannot be parsed from the file name. Previously, when Supplier needed to be identified and could not be, the file would import successfully with Supplier indicated as Unknown.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2246</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected handling of Notes in ACES Importer</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously during Application ID generation, the ID of a Note was used rather than the text. As ID is an optional parameter on a Note, this could lead to cases where an application would be skipped as a duplicate because the Note was not recognized properly due to the missing ID information. The ACES Importer has been updated to include the Note text (rather than the ID) in the generation of the hash function that is used in an application record ID. As this changed the algorithm of the application ID generator, <b>all previously imported application records should be deleted and re-imported to match the new ID generation pattern. </b></p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2080, 2081</MadCap:conditionalText>Labels added to Bulk Updates and Delete actions in Web UI Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the Bulk Applications Updates and Delete Application actions available in the Application Editor in Web UI did not contain any default labels, and manually entered labels would not render on the screen. This has been corrected so that a default label is present for both actions, and when the default is overwritten, it is shown on the screen.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2083</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected Application Asset Reference header in Web UI Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when adding the Application Asset Reference header to the application results table, it would display with "Not configured" as the header. This has been corrected so that 'Application Asset Reference' is displayed as the default header, which can be updated via configuration.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2086</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected presentation of null options in the Web UI Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when adding an option via the Condition header in the application results table, in some cases if an option was selected but no value applied, the table would display 'null.' This has been corrected so that the cell remains unpopulated if no value is applied.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2148</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected behavior of the part selection cell in the Web UI Application Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the part selection cell (e.g., Part Number) included a node picker so that users could browse and select a part. This was unintentionally removed and users were only able to select parts via typing in the cell. This has been corrected so that the node picker is again available when clicking in the cell. </p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2148</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected handling of Engine and Axle in TecDoc Export</p>
        <p class="Body3">The TecDoc TAF 2.4 Exporter did not handle the export of engine or axle criteria correctly. This has been fixed so that they are exported properly.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2211</MadCap:conditionalText>Added warning for delete records in an ACES FULL file in the ACES Importer</p>
        <p class="Body3">When the Submission Type of an ACES file=FULL, it means that all records in the input file should comprise the full set of data in the database, per the replacement rules for that system. Therefore, deletions are not supported in replacement scenarios (e.g., Submission Type = FULL or Submission Type = UPDATE and Partial Replacement is selected as the replacement method). Previously, if a deletion is passed in a FULL file (e.g., action="D"), the record was skipped but the user was not notified that this had occurred. The importer has been updated so that the Conversion execution report now includes a warning for any records that are skipped due to being deletions when a replacement scenario is in effect.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2099</MadCap:conditionalText>Fixed bug with multi-valued attribute handling in Web UI Application Record Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">When working with multi-valued attributes in the criteria / option editor within the Application Record Editor, adding multiple values for an attribute would generate an exception. This has been corrected.</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-20448</MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected issue with Date attributes in Web UI Application Record Editor</p>
        <p class="Body3">Using the Condition Group Header in the editor, attributes with validation type 'ISO Date' or 'ISO Date and Time' were being displayed using the client browser locales (date format) not system locales like in other components (e.g., Attribute Value Header), which resulted in validations errors. This has been fixed to display 'ISO Date' and 'ISO Date and Time' attributes with system locales (like other Web UI components).</p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2088</MadCap:conditionalText>Compressed View button added to Application Record Editor Web UI screens where it was missing</p>
        <p class="Body3">The Compressed / Normal View button (label changes as the view modes are toggled between) was missing from several Web UI screens that use the application editor. Specifically, the screens designed for viewing applications from a vehicle / assembly or part / article were missing the option. This has been added to all screens where it was missing. The Web UI easy setup option should be re-run for any standards that had been previously set up to have the button added. </p>
