        <p class="Body3">The Automotive functionality now includes an Application Suggestion solution that makes it easy to maintain data related to  applications of a selected part. This not only helps users more easily view, edit, and create applications for specific parts, but also suggests potential matches. In other words, when configured, STEP can suggest potential matches for applications based on existing competitor and/or OE part number's applications and/or other defined part number's applications within STEP. When a part is selected, STEP looks at the configured Reference Types and displays their Target's applications.</p>

        <p class="Body3">The PMDM for Automotive 9.1 MP2 now includes new Faceted Search functionality. It is faster, easier, and provides many different aspects of searching for Assembly / Vehicle. This function becomes very useful while applicating a Part to the Assembly / Vehicle.

        <p class="Body3">Two new parameters  ('Create Application Business Action' and 'Do not set name') are now added to the Application Set Part column header to provide control over the naming convention of the application records being created via the Application Manager screen. Previously, when application data was created using the Application Manager screen, the name of the application record  was created using the Part Type, Part Name, Year, Make, and Model from the system wherein the ACES Importer included a business action that specified the naming convention as configured in the business action. Now, it is possible to execute a business action on new applications and set the desired name via the business action. Selecting the 'Do not set name' parameter ensures that the new applications will not have default names.  Configuring  'Create Application Business Action' parameter  with a Business Action will make the Application Manager run the Business Action  thereby setting the name of the newly created application records as defined in the Business Action. When using a Business Action to set the application record name, make sure that the 'Do not set name' parameter is selected so that the name is only set through the Business Action.</p>
