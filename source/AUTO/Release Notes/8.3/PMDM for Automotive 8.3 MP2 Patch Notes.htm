        <p class="Body3">Now available within an Application Manager screen, the Saved Search Tool allows users to quickly populate previously saved search criteria by selecting the name of a saved search from the saved search dropdown. Saved searches can consist of many different combinations of intelligent search interface selections, including criteria within one or more search boxes, existing and/or missing application coverage selection, and/or brand selection. For more information, see the <b>Saved Search Tool</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Application Manager/Intelligent Search Interface/Saved Search Tool.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within the <b>Application Manger</b> section of the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b>.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Now available within an Application Manager screen, the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown allows  users to restrict the Application Manager search results by object type. Users can select from a pre-configured dropdown list of  object types. This can be helpful when search results need to be filtered by Brand, Manufacturer, OEM, Product Line, etc. This option can be removed from the Application Manager screen by removing all object types from the Hierarchy Restriction Object Types parameter. For more information, see the <b>Hierarchy Restriction dropdown</b> functionality section of the <b>Intelligent Search Interface</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Application Manager/Intelligent Search Interface/Intelligent Search Interface.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b>.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Now, when Easy Setup actions are completed for each standard, a respective Application Manager screen is automatically created. Additionally, a quick link to the Application Manager screen is added to the Quick Links Widget on the home page. Additional steps are required to insure the quick link functions correctly. For more information, see the <b>Application Manager</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Application Manager/Application Manager.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b>.</p>

        <p class="Body3">Many bugfixes have been made to the Application Manager, but are not listed in detail within this release. </p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2872 </MadCap:conditionalText>Updated Easy Setup to no longer create some links within the Quick Links Widget</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, Easy Setup for all three standards (AutoCare, NAPA, TecDoc) created the following Navigation screens in the Quick Links widget on the homepage: Advanced Search, Browse, Basket. However, because these screens require additional configuration, they would display as blank. Now, Easy Setup only creates the link to the Application Manager screen created for the standard. The link name displays using the following syntax: '[Standard Name] Application Manager.' </p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Existing Implementations</b>: Easy Setup actions can be re-run to properly configure the Application Manager screen. The quick link to that Application Manager screen will be added to the bottom of the Quick Links list. </p>

        <p class="Body3">Within the Application Manager, the 'Show missing applications only' option  has been updated to 'Missing Applications Only.'</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">PRODOC note: RDCUST-2825 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected SAX Parse Exception error during delta calculation import state when context mode is used</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, when using the following importers, a SAX Parse Exception error would occur during the delta calculation import state if the 'context' mode was configured: PCdb, PAdb, or VCdb. The error has been corrected so that the importers can pass the Delta Calculation Import state successfully when either the context or file calculation mode is configured. </p>
        <p class="MPNHeadNoTOC">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2911 </MadCap:conditionalText>Corrected the use of 'BrandAAIAID' when creating PIES Item objects</p>
        <p class="Body3">Previously, the AutoCareMappingBackgroundService used in a 'Run background process action' business rule created PIES Item objects with the Brand Name instead of the BrandAAIAID. This caused ACES exports to fail because the exporter could not recognize the ID for the PIES Items. Now, the  AutoCareMappingBackgroundService  creates the PIES Item ID using the following ID structure: AC_PIESItem_[BrandAAIAID]_[PartNumber].</p>
        <h2 class="MPNDocumentation">Documentation Updates</h2>
        <p class="Body3">Enhancement of the PMDM for Automotive online help documentation is continuous, and updates are released with each maintenance patch. When these updates are significant and/or include high-level content reorganizations, they are communicated within the patch notes.</p>
