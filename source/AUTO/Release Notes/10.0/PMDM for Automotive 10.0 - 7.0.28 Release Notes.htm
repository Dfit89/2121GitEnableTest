            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" style="color: #4b0082;">Internal Note: RDCUST- 4155</MadCap:conditionalText>Added support to access  'Onboarding mapping navigator' component in the new Global Navigation Panel</p>
        <p class="Body3">The released core code for STEP&#160;10.0 has superseded the existing Stack Panel component by a new component called Global Navigation Panel. Earlier, the Mapper Configuration setup entity was allowed to be configured within the Stack Panel component for access within the Web UI. Now, the Mapper Configuration setup entity can be accessed through the Global Navigation Panel too.</p>
        <p class="Body3">For users, this means that the Stack Panel component  is not completely removed (deleted) yet. However, as the alternate component is now announced, it is very important for customers to make sure they are using the Global Navigation Panel component for accessing the Mapper Configuration setup entity after this upgrade. Details on how to configure the Global Navigation Panel is outlined in the Global Navigation Panel topic in the Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started documentation of the STEP Online Help<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Main Properties/Global Navigation Panel.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref>. And for information on adding the 'Onboarding mapping navigator' component in the Global Navigation Panel, see the Onboarding Mappings Details Screen topic of the Automotive Reference Guide<MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Exporters/Standard_AC/AutoCare PIES Exporter.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. </p>

        <h2 class="MPNDownload">Patch recipe</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Automotive add-on can be installed with the following recipe:</p>
        <p class="Body3"><span class="commandfont">to:automotive/7.0/automotive-7.0.28.</span><span MadCap:createDate="2018-10-04T09:05:58.3700255-04:00" MadCap:creator="medu" MadCap:initials="MEDU" MadCap:comment="update the Patch Recipe and Compatibility topic too" MadCap:editor="medu" MadCap:editDate="2018-10-10T15:52:58.2899872-04:00" class="commandfont">spr</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Body3">The above recipe is compatible with the following STEP 10.0 baseline recipe: </p>
        <p class="Body3"><span><span class="commandfont">to:step/platform/step-10.0.spr</span></span>
        </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Once an Automotive add-on is installed to a base STEP system, the base system cannot be upgraded without upgrading the Automotive add-on at the same time. Additionally, when upgrading any base STEP system that has any Automotive add-on installed, both install recipes must be prepared at the same time. </p>
