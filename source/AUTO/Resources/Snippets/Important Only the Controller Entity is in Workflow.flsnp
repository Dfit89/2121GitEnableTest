        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">It is critical to understand that it is only the Controller Entity that is in the workflow - the objects being acted on (created / updated / deleted) via information supplied in the import file are not in the workflow. Therefore, running standard business actions acting on current object will impact the Controller Entity only, not the objects in the input file. In order for the Business Action to act on the objects  being imported, the Business Action must be added to the 'Import action' parameter on the 'Import' state.
