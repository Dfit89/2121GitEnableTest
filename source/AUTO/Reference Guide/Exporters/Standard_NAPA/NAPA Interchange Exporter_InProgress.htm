        <h1>NAPA Interchange Exporter</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2678, 2681</p>
        <p class="Body1">The NAPA Interchange Exporter is used to export interchange data that resides in a NAPA product hierarchy. Users can select an object from the NAPA product hierarchy, and the NAPA Interchange objects beneath the selected object (both child objects and linked objects) will be exported. The export file is then available in the NAPA Interchange format.</p>
        <p>A new 'NAPA Interchange Exporter' format has been implemented, allowing for the export of Interchanges. The NAPA Interchange Exporter will export interchanges that are referenced by a NAPA Product using the 'Product To Interchange Product' reference. The exporter uses a parameter to indicate which Product Line to export. This way when a Product is linked to multiple MPCCs, an interchange export is possible. If a Product Line is not specified, then all Product Lines will be included in the exported file with a row for each Product Line for the same Part Number. If a Product Line is specified in the parameter, then the exported file will only contain part numbers and interchanges relevant for the chosen Product Line.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">NAPA Data Model Requirements</p>
        <p class="Body1">The exporter requires applications be stored in the standard NAPA data model. </p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">NAPA Product  Requirements</p>
        <p>The NAPA Product MPCC is expected to have an ID structure prefixed with NAPA_MPCC_, and the NAPA Product is expected to have the following ID structure: NAPA_Product_[Line Abbrev][PartNumber] (i.e., NAPA_Product_FIL1515). When a NAPA Product is created, the NAPA&#160;Part Number attribute (NAPA_PartNumber) must be populated with the Part Number value, as this attribute value is used to the determine the Part Number in the NAPA Interchange Exporter. </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Because some Product Lines only have two characters,  the NAPA Product Number, if used without the overlying ID&#160;structure, might create an inconsistent pattern when trying to use the Product Number for the ID.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Object Type Requirements</p>
        <p class="Body1">The following object types must exist within STEP: ExportBaselineRoot (Alternate Classification) and ExportBaselineAsset (Assets). As of the Automotive 8.3 release, these object types are created automatically when Easy Setup is run via System Setup &gt; Component Models &gt; Automotive - NAPA&#160;Model &gt; Right-click Automotive - NAPA&#160;Model &gt; 1. Configure NAPA&#160;Data Model.</p>
        <p class="Body1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">MEDU: Per PAKA we moved interchanges from the classification hierarchy to the product hierarchy. Do not have to have an application... just a product. We create a reference from the product to the (Product to Interchange Product) also (Product to MPCC references) </p>
