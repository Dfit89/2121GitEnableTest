            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: BOND PRODOC-1856 </MadCap:conditionalText>When configured, the 'Application Approval Status' component can be used to display the approval status of the application records within an Application Manager Results Table and/or Application Editor Screen. The addition of this column will help filter the applications based on their approval status. Additionally, within a cell, an Information icon (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/2.png" />) will be visible that provides detailed information on the approval status.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Prerequisites</p>
        <p>It is expected that anyone configuring the Application Approval Status component is familiar with the Web UI Designer as basic concepts for working with the designer are not covered in this section. In addition, the user must have appropriate privileges to access the designer. Additional information can be found in the <b>Designer Access</b> section of the <b>Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Web UI Getting Started/Designer Access.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For information about accessing and configuring the Node List component, see the <b>Node List Component</b> topic within the <b>Web User Interfaces</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Node List Component.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Configuration Steps</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Application Approval Status component can be added within any of the display modes available in the Node list Properties for the selected Application Manager Screen (or Application Editor Screen). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"> Each of the parameters for the Application Approval Status Properties are described below.</MadCap:conditionalText>Below are the steps to configure the Application Approval Status component.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Using the Web UI designer as shown in the image below, go to Node List Properties &gt; Multi Edit Display Mode Headers parameter for the Application Manager Screen (or Application Editor Screen) that needs to display application approval status.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>Add</b> button for the Headers parameter, and the Add Component dialog will display.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Find and select the <b>Application Approval Status</b> component.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>Add</b> button, and the Application Approval Status Properties dialog will display (as shown below).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/3.png" />
        </p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li class="Numbered1">Optionally, populate the parameters listed below.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="BulletStibo"><b>Dimensions:</b> By default, the parameter is blank. Optionally, to configure the column width and height, select 'Table Header Dimensions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="BulletStibo"><b>Label:</b> By default, the parameter is blank. But after clicking the <b>Add</b> button, the default column header label (Approval Status) will be stored. Optionally, enter the desired label to be displayed as the column header within the Application Manager results table.</li>
            <li class="BulletStibo"><b>Table Sorting:</b> By default, the parameter is blank. Optionally, select from the dropdown values to specify the default sorting order of the column data.
</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="6">
            <li class="Numbered1">
                <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Once the required parameters are populated, the Add button will activate. </MadCap:conditionalText>Click the <b>SAVE</b> button to save the newly added component to the Headers parameter.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Optionally, on the Node List Properties Headers parameter, use the <b>Up</b> and/or <b>Down</b> buttons to configure the order in which the newly added column should display within the results table. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>Save</b> and <b>Close</b> buttons for the designer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When a search is performed in the Application Manager Screen, the Application Manager results table will display the application records with the approval status of each application as shown below.</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are three Approval statuses that can be displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1"><b>Approved:</b> This status is displayed when the object and all of its parent nodes and referenced target objects are fully approved.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1"><b>Can't be approved:</b> This status is displayed when  the object has either never been approved, or that the object cannot be fully approved because there are parent nodes or referenced target objects that have not been fully approved yet.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1"><b>Not approved:</b> This status is displayed when  the target has been previously fully approved but now a change has been made in the object that requires it to be approved again (such as changing an attribute value).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And when users click on the Information icon (<img src="../../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/2.png" />), the reason(s) for the application record for not being approved or cannot be approved is displayed as shown below.</p>
