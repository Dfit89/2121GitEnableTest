        <h1>Saved Search Tool</h1>
        <p>Users can quickly populate previously saved search criteria by selecting the name of a saved search from the saved search dropdown. Saved searches can consist of many different combinations of intelligent search interface selections, including criteria within one or more search boxes, existing and/or missing application coverage selection, and/or brand selection. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Once one or more search criteria selections are made, users can save the  selections with a custom name. Using previously saved searches can be helpful when the same search criteria is needed repeatedly, or when using a basic set of saved search criteria aids users in more quickly building complex searches. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Saved searches are restricted by User login, Web UI, Vehicle Type Search Panel, and Screen ID. In other words, users will only see the saved searches created with their login for the specific Web UI being used. Additionally, this allows users to create a succinct list of saved searches that is relative to each Vehicle Type Search Panel. </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The saved search tool does not save search results, but rather the search box criteria, existing and/or missing application dropdown selection, and/or brand selection. Once a saved search is selected from the dropdown, the Search and/or Report buttons can be used to view the search results.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The saved search tool is located at the bottom left of the intelligent search interface (below the  first search box), and  consists of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Saved search dropdown:</b> Allows users to select the name of a previously saved search from an alphabetized list of saved search names.</li>
            <li><b>Save icon:</b> Allows users to save the intelligent search interface selections (i.e., criteria within search boxes, existing or missing application coverage selection, brand selection) by either creating a new saved search or overwriting an existing saved search. </li>
            <li><b>Rename icon:</b> Allows users to edit the name of the selected saved search.</li>
            <li><b>Delete icon:</b> Allows users to delete the selected saved search.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Saving a Search</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Save icon is disabled until at least one criterion is added, removed, or edited. The steps involved with saving search criteria are different when a new saved search is being created, versus an existing search being  overwritten. This section will first address the steps involved with creating a new saved search, and then overwriting an existing saved search. </p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Creating a Saved Search</p>
        <p class="Body1"> Once one or more criteria have been added to a search box, and the Save icon is enabled, the following steps can be used to create a new saved search.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Save icon, and the 'Save search' dialog will display as shown below.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved Search Criteria/1.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">As long as a saved search has not been selected (thus the saved search dropdown is blank), then the Save search dialog will display as shown above. </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Within the Name parameter, type a name that best describes the saved search. The name can be created using any alphanumeric combination, but should be easy to identify for future use in the saved search dropdown.</li>
            <li>Once at least one character is entered into the Name parameter, the OK button is enabled. Click the OK button to finish creating the saved search. The Save search dialog will close and the newly created saved search will display in the saved search dropdown.</li>
        </ol>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Cancel button closes dialog no changes.flsnp" />
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Overwriting an Existing Search</p>
        <p class="Body1">When a saved search is selected in the dropdown, one or more criteria have been added or removed from a search box, and the Save icon is enabled, the following steps can be used to overwrite a saved search.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Save icon, and the 'Save search' dialog will display as shown below.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved Search Criteria/Overwrite.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">As long as a saved search has been selected (thus the saved search dropdown is populated), then the Save search dialog will display as shown above. </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Overwrite existing search:</b> By default, the 'Overwrite existing search' option is selected. Choosing this option will overwrite the currently selected saved search  with the newly edited criteria. </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Save as new search:</b> Selecting the 'Save as new search' option will enable the Name parameter. By default, the Name parameter is populated with the currently selected saved search name appended with '(1).' Populate the Name parameter in a way that is easy to identify for future use in the saved search dropdown.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Once the desired option is selected and/or populated, click the OK&#160;button. The Save search dialog will close and the newly created saved search will display in the saved search dropdown.</li>
        </ol>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Cancel button closes dialog no changes.flsnp" />
        <h2>Renaming a Saved Search</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Once a previously saved search name is selected from the dropdown and the Rename icon is enabled,  the following steps can be used to edit the name of a saved search.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Rename icon, and the Rename Search dialog will display the Name parameter populated with the current name of the saved search. In the example below, the Acura Applications Saved search was used.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved Search Criteria/2.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li> Populate the Name parameter in a way that is easy to identify for future use in the saved search dropdown.</li>
            <li>Once the desired Name is populated, click the OK button to save the change.</li>
        </ol>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Cancel button closes dialog no changes.flsnp" />
        <h2>Deleting a Saved Search</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Once a previously saved search name is selected from the dropdown, and the Delete icon is enabled,  the following steps can be used to delete the saved search. </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Once the saved search is deleted, it will no longer display for selection in the dropdown, and cannot be recovered.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Delete icon, and the Delete dialog will display confirming the Name of the saved search to be deleted (as shown below). </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Saved Search Criteria/Delete.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click the OK button, the dialog will close, and the saved search will no longer display in the dropdown list.</li>
        </ol>
