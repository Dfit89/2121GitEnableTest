            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2721</MadCap:conditionalText>The Year search box allows users to add one or more year criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Year search box. For more information on the general functionality found within the search boxes, see the <b>Using Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Boxes.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When the cursor is placed within the typeahead field for the Year search box, and all other search boxes are blank, the dropdown will not display until at least one number is typed into the typeahead field. However, when one or more criteria are added to the Make/Model search box, and then the cursor is placed within the Year field, a dropdown list will display with only those years that pertain to the criteria within the other synchronized search boxes. For example, when the Make/Model search box is populated with the '4Runner' criterion, and the cursor is placed within the typeahead field of the Year search box, then a list of years from 1984-2018 displays. However, when the Sub Model search box is populated with the 'TRD Pro' criterion, and then the cursor is placed within the typeahead field of the Year search box, then a list of years from 2015-2018 displays (as shown below).</p>

        <p class="note1">The Make/Model search box must be populated with at least one criterion for the dropdown options for the Year and Options search boxes to automatically display when the cursor is placed within the search box field.</p>
