        <h1>Using Part Type Search Box</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Part Type Search Box allows users to add one or more part type criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Part type search box. For more information on the general functionality found within the search boxes, see the <b>Using Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Boxes.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Within the Part Type Search Box, the typeahead field can be used to search for part type criteria, and the use of an asterisk will allow for a wildcard search. Only part type Names are searched, not IDs. The dropdown list displays criteria options alphabetically. For example, if '*spark plug' is typed into the field, then the dropdown list displays the any part type name containing 'spark plug' alphabetically (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Additionally, users can browse for the Part Type criteria by clicking the node picker browse icon located to the right of the Make/Model typeahead field. In the screenshot below,  the Part Type Browse dialog displays after the node picker browse icon is selected.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2883 The following functionality was enabled via RDCUST-2130 but then later changed. </MadCap:conditionalText>When searching on Part Type, the part type link must be established on an application or part in order for the applications to be displayed in the search results table. If the part type link is on the part and the application does not have a link, then it will inherit from the part. If the application has a link, then it will override the link that’s on the part. For example, if a user is searching for the Part Type Spark Plugs, and an application is not linked to Spark Plugs (in AutoCare, the Product to Classification Link Type ID = AC_ProductToPartTerminology), then that application will not display in the search results table.</p>
