        <h1>Using Make/Model Search Box</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Make/Model search box allows users to add one or more make and/or model criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Make/Model search box. For more information on the general functionality found within the search boxes, see the <b>Using Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Boxes.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2786 </MadCap:conditionalText> Within the Make/Model Search Box, the typeahead field can be used to search for make and/or model criteria. The dropdown list will display the criteria options alphabetically by Make, and then by Model. Models are always displayed below their respective Make. For example, if 'a4' is typed into the field, then the dropdown list displays the Audi, Austin, Checker, and Mercedes-Benz makes alphabetically, and the Models that match the information typed into the field (a4) will be listed alphabetically below their respective makes (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p>If the text typed in matches a make only, then all Models below that make will be displayed. For example, if 'maz' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Mazda make with all its available Models listed below.</p>
        <p class="Image2">

        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p>If the text typed in  matches a model only,  then the make for the matching model is displayed with only the model that matches the search string. For example, if 'fox' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Audi and Volkswagen makes with the 'Fox' Models listed below.</p>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/Make Model fox dropdown.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If the text typed in matches the make AND Model, then the matching makes and/or Models will display within the dropdown for selection. For example, if 'opel' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Buick make with the Opel model beneath, and then the Opel make will display with all of its available Models below. </p>

        </p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p>To search for a make within a specific Model, two or more characters can be typed into the field to narrow down the Make, then using the keyboard space bar allows for the following text to conduct a 'contains' search for Models. For example, to display all the Audi models containing Quattro, then the following can be entered into the Make/Model field: 'aud [space bar] qua.'</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2624 </MadCap:conditionalText>Additionally, users can browse for the Make/Model criteria by clicking the browse icon located to the right of the Make/Model typeahead field. In the screenshot below,  the Make/Model Browse dialog displays after the node picker browse icon is selected.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Recommended practice is to provide at least one value for the Make/Model search box, otherwise longer than expected wait times can occur. When the use of broad search criteria is required, recommended practice is to use the Application Coverage Report by clicking the Report button within the Application Manager. For more information about running a search without the Make/Model search box populated, see the <b>Minimum Search Criteria</b> section of the <b>Using Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Boxes.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
