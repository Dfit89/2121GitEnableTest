        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU Per a note from KRMA in section 5.1.12 of the Spec Doc for the Rebuild of the Application finders project - we need to provide good help text and limit the amount of documentation necessary for configuration. Sadly the documentation was needed before the help text could be prioritized. I&#160;tried to keep the OLH&#160;minimal knowing the help text would be done soon. https://stibo.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/SYS-SC1/PDOGlobal/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7Bfd576409-28ab-44cf-9709-4086b83d6bb5%7D&amp;action=default</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Easy Setup actions must be run for each standard that will be accessed using an Application Manager, and by default each standard is configured to use their own instance of an Application Manager. Optionally, after Easy Setup actions have configured an Application Manager, the Vehicle Type Search Panel and results table columns can be manually modified. Before doing this, it is helpful to review how the Vehicle Type Search Panel and results table are used per the <b>Using Intelligent Search Interface</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Intelligent Search Interface/Using Intelligent Search Interface.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref>, the <b>Results Table and Toolbar</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Results Table/Results Table and Toolbar.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref>, and then review the search box configuration options within this topic. Additionally, for information on adding columns to the results table, see the <b>Adding Additional Headers to Application Screens</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../../../Quick Start Guide/Admin QSG/Adding Additional Headers to Application Screens.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within the <b>Automotive Quick Start Guide</b>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When Easy Setup actions have been used to create a standard data model, by default, much of the Application Manager is ready to be used, including the addition of an easy to use link to the Application Manager screen from the Quick Links widget on the Web UI Homepage. For more information, see the <b>Application Manager</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Application Manager.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. </p>

        <h2>Own Model Considerations</h2>
        <p class="Body1">An Application Manager screen can be configured for use with an Own model. It is easiest to accomplish this after first using the Easy Setup actions to configure the Automotive - Application Model for an automotive standard. </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">For an Application Manager to function properly, some component model types (i.e., Part Type) may need to be configured, even if otherwise not needed. </p>
        <p class="Body1">To implement an Own model within an Application Manager screen, the following must be in place: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>All components within the Automotive - Application Model must be populated with a value. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">For more information about each of the components, see the topic </MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li>The Application, Assembly, Part, Part type, Part type list, Application to assembly, Leading part relation, Leading part type relation, Part type link type, and Part type list to part type aspects must be configured with Own object types and references in the Automotive - Application Model component.</li>
            <li>Create a new Product to Classification Link Type and define the own part and application object types as valid Product Types, and the own part type object type as a valid Classification Type. Then add this new Product to Classification Link Type to the 'Part type link type' aspect within the Automotive - Application Model<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2018-05-18T16:04:08.8630932-04:00" MadCap:creator="medu" MadCap:initials="MEDU" MadCap:comment="3 and 4 may pertain to all configurations of the model (all standards) If I create a topic with our completed Data model displayed then I can address each component there - for now I am leaving these here since OWN is hard to setup." MadCap:editor="medu" MadCap:editDate="2018-05-18T16:05:05.8141805-04:00">.</MadCap:annotation></li>
            <li>The 'Part type list to part type' aspect requires a Classification Reference Type to connect a part type list / group to a part type that is used in behind the scene code (not visible for a user to interact with). The object type that is used for the Valid Source Type in the reference must also be defined in the ‘Part type list’ aspect. The object type that is used for the Valid Target Type must also be defined in the ‘Part type’ aspect.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>The Vehicle Type Search Panel within an Application Manager must be configured to use the Own application and vehicle object types, and Own vehicle root node.</li>
            <li>The own application must have the references established to the own vehicle and part type.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Configuring an Application Manager Screen in Web UI</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Steps to configure an Application Manager screen in Web UI are below.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Automotive Note for Configuration Dialog for Add and Edit.flsnp" />
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;"> Easy Setup actions for at least one standard must be run before an Application Manager Screen can be manually added to a Web UI and configured for that standard. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to the Web UI where the Application Manager will be used, and access the Web UI Designer.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>New</b> button at the top of the Designer, and the Add Screen dialog will display.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">

        </p>
        <p class="Body2">Within the Application Manager Screen Properties dialog, the following parameter is required:</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Vehicle Type Search Panel:</b> Allows for up to six different Vehicle Type Search Panels to be configured within each Application Manager. Populating this required parameter allows for a Vehicle type icon and Vehicle Type Search Panel to display within the Application Manager. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2618 The number of allowed Vehicle Type Search Panels is dependent upon the padding applied to the icons. If the padding changes, the warning message automatically adjusts. </MadCap:conditionalText>If more than <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">five </MadCap:conditionalText>six vehicle type search panels are added, only the first <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">five </MadCap:conditionalText>six vehicle types listed will display for the Application Manager user. Additionally, a warning  dialog will display each time the Designer is accessed informing the user that more vehicle type search panels are configured than can be displayed. In the example below, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">six </MadCap:conditionalText>seven vehicle type search panels have been configured.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU Per my and NIFE findings when she removed the VCDB and the default AC vehicle type disappeared: </MadCap:conditionalText>If a vehicle search type is created, and the vehicle root node that has been configured for the Vehicle Type is later removed from STEP, then the vehicle search type created within the Application Manager will no longer display. If the vehicle root node  is re-created, then the Application Manager will display as it did before the vehicle root node was deleted. </p>
        <p class="Body2">Within the Application Manager Screen Properties dialog, the following parameters are optional:</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2741 It must be possible to search for application records using Part classification (Product Lines) It must be possible to search for application using a criterion that defines the associated parts by classification hierarchy that they are located in.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Application Scope Value:</b> This parameter sets the default drop down value in the Missing Application Coverage functionality within Application Manager Screen. Within this parameter, user can set default values to either 'Existing Applications Only' or 'Existing and Missing Applications' or 'Missing Applications.' Typically, this parameter is used to set the default value in the dropdown located below the search boxes of Application Manager Screen, which can help users to perform required search without changing the options every time. Despite the default setting in the Application Scope Value parameter, user can still swap amongst the options in Application Manager Screen to perform required search. For information on missing application coverage functionality, see the <b>Missing Application Coverage Functionality</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Missing Application Coverage Functionality.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Hierarchy Restriction Label:</b> Type a label that best describes the Hierarchy Restriction option to the Application Manager user. By default, the label is populated with 'All data.' If users are filtering by brand, then 'Brand' could be an appropriate label.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Hierarchy Restriction Object Types:</b> Allows  users to restrict the Application Manager search results by an object type. Users can select from a pre-configured dropdown list of  product or classification object types. This can be helpful when search results needs to be filtered by Brand, Manufacturer, OEM, Product Line, etc. Once an object types is added, it will display in the dropdown list. Use the Up and/or Down buttons to edit the order of the dropdown list, as the objects will display to the user in the order listed within the parameter. When the parameter is blank, the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown will not display within the Application Manager. Adding at least one object type to the parameter will result in the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown displaying below the search boxes of the Application Manager. </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Title:</b> If desired, type in a title which will display on the screen in the top left corner. If no text is entered, no label is displayed.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Default Node List:</b> This parameter functions as the generic Node List component for all the Vehicle Type Search Panel listed within the Vehicle Type Search Panels parameter unless  a specific  configuration is done on each individual Vehicle Type Search Panel. Select 'Node List' option in the dropdown and click on the 'go to component' to further configure the Node List component.

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Object type(s) selected for this parameter must be configured as an Application within the 'Automotive - Application Model.' Easy Setup configures the Automotive - Application Model in this way.  </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Any object that is selected, and is configured as an Application in the Automotive - Application Model, will be displayed in the search results table. For example, a user can have their own application, as well as an AutoCare ACES application.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">When applications are created, their object type is determined based on the part number that is applied to the Vehicle. For example, if part number 123 is a PIES Item, and part number 456 is a Own part number, then when a user applies part number 123 to a Vehicle, then the application record is created using an ACES application object type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Search Box Types:</b> Allows one to four search boxes to be added to the Vehicle Type Search Panel. Only one search box is required, and each search box type can be added only once. The order listed determines the order of display within the Application Manager search panel. The Part Type search box type does not require additional configuration, whereas the other search box types do. Clicking the Add button below the Search Box Types parameter displays an Add Component dialog with the option to add one of the following search box types: Make/Model, Options Group, Part Type, and Year.
