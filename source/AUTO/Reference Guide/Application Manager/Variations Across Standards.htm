        <h1>Variations Across Standards</h1>
        <p class="Body1">There are terminology variations within the Application Manager for each standard, as well as minor variations in the available headers for the results table. </p>
        <p class="Body1">For example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">AutoCare offers  search results column headers labeled as Vehicle, Part Terminology, and Part. </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">AutoCare contains a Qualifiers header, whereas a TecDoc editor does not. </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">NAPA  offers  search results column headers labeled as Vehicle, MPCC, NAPA Product, Conditions, and Comments.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">TecDoc offers search results column headers labeled as Assembly, Generic Article, and Article.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">Despite these differences, the overall functionality is the same, allowing users to search for applications, and view and edit application data. The upper half of the screen provides the search functionality, and the lower half of the screen displays the results and allows for editing of application records<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2018-04-18T12:02:34.9453949-04:00" MadCap:creator="medu" MadCap:initials="MEDU" MadCap:comment="Read-only functionality is not yet avail" MadCap:editor="medu" MadCap:editDate="2018-04-18T12:02:48.1968995-04:00"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"> (unless a read-only configuration is applied)</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:annotation>. </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Each implementation has the option to add and remove data to the results display. Additionally, the vehicle options / criteria that are displayed vary dynamically by the part types included in the results, based on configuration options which are described below.</p>
