        <h1>Base Vehicle Applications</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Part application data is not applied to Vehicle object types (i.e., <b>1996 Dodge Viper, GTS, United States</b>) but rather to Base Vehicle object types (i.e.,<b> 1996 Dodge Viper</b>). Thus, an application is applied to the parent of the Vehicle object type.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, the <b>1996 Dodge Viper</b> Base Vehicle object type is displayed along with its four children vehicle object types</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/1996DodgeViperBaseVehicle.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">In order to know all valid body style configurations for a Base Vehicle object type, all child vehicles (the 'Base' and 'GTS' vehicles for the United States and Canada) must first be evaluated. In doing this, it can be seen that the 1996 Dodge Viper Base Canada and United States models have a <b>2 door, Convertible</b> body style (as shown below) whereas the 1996 Dodge Viper GTS Canada and United States models have the <b>2 door, Coupe</b> body style (as previously mentioned).</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/QS/1996DodgeViperBase.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Therefore the <b>1996 Dodge Viper Base Vehicle</b> object type has two valid body style configurations; both have only 2 doors, but the body type can be either Coupe or Convertible. If a user tries to provide an application for the vehicle that specifies '4' doors or a 'Sport Utility' Vehicle body style, it would be allowed, but also invalid.</p>
