        <h1>Using Search by Card Screen Interface</h1>
        <p>The Search by Card Screen intelligent search interface has been carefully designed to allow users to quickly and easily select criteria for valid combinations of Name, parent hierarchy, and attribute values. This allows users to create accurate  search criteria on the fly and benefit from the customized search results. This is accomplished by allowing users to select only valid criteria across multiple search cards per the configuration of the Search by Card Screen.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Each Search by Card Screen can be configured to display up to five search cards.  Of the available options, Name Search Box and Hierarchy Search Box components can be added only once and Attribute Search Box can be added multiple times. Within each search card, a  typeahead field is used to view and select valid search criteria. Because only valid criteria can be selected within each typeahead field, the Search by Card Screen provides automated intelligence for each search. Thanks to the synchronization of the search cards, the valid criteria is considered upon each selection and within any of the displayed search cards, no matter the order of entry. </p>
        <p class="Body1">For example, if the Hierarchy search card contains a Base Vehicle that was only produced from 2011-2018, then the typeahead field within the attribute search card (configured to display VCdb Year attribute) will only allow to enter those years for selection (notice that the initial characters of the attribute value have to be typed in the type ahead field). Because Audi (Make) has A1 (Model) beginning with the 2011 model year, the available years are displayed as 2011-2018 when ‘A1’ is selected within the Hierarchy search card (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">However, if an additional Model (A3 ) is added to the Hierarchy search card, then the available years display as 2010-2019 (notice that the initial characters that are typed in the typeahead field are '201').</p>
