        <h1>Configuring the Copy Application to Other Assembly Business Action in Workbench</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The 'Copy application to other assembly' business operation is found within the STEP Workbench  Business Rule Editor under the Automotive menu and requires population of a single parameter  (Copy application to other assembly parameter key). However, setup is required within both STEP Workbench and Web UI for the action to be available to users. This section addresses the steps necessary within the workbench.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Create the business action with a name that accurately describes to the user what this action will do. The name of the business action displays within the Web UI and should be easy for the user to identify. For this example, the business action name is 'Copy Application To Other Assembly.'</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The business action Name will display to the Application Manager user once the Bulk Updates action button is selected. If more than one bulk update is configured, then the name displays both within the Bulk Applications Update dialog, and within the copy application to other assembly dialog where the user enters the assembly for the application (as shown in the example within the <b>Using the Configured  Copy Application To Other Assembly Business Action in Web UI</b> section of the <b>Business Action: Copy Application To Other Assembly</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Business Action Copy Application to Other Assembly.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Edit the new business rule, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/click ellipsis button.flsnp" /> next  to the Valid Object Types parameter and select the valid object types for this business action. For this example, the 'ACES Application' object type is selected, however the TecDoc and NAPA applications can also be selected within the same or separate business actions. This decision is at the discretion of the administrator. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">On the Operations tab of the Business Rule Editor, click the <b>Add new Business Action</b> link, and click the edit button to open the Edit Operation dialog. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Use the dropdown menu within the Edit Operation dialog to select <b>Automotive</b> &gt; <b>Copy application to other assembly</b> operation, and the parameter 'Copy application to other assembly parameter key'   will display (as shown above).</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Within the parameter enter a unique way (key) to identify this  rule. Uniqueness is the only restriction for this key. It will not be displayed to the user. It is case sensitive.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="important2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Common setup is to copy the key so it can be pasted in the Web UI designer when configuring the  business action in Web UI. </p>
