        <h1>Use Cases - Tracking Deleted Objects</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The user is responsible for configuring STEP to keep track of all the deleted objects on subsequent imports and handle the deleted objects manually in the system.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">While importing, if an object is missing in the import file compared to what is in STEP, the import does not automatically delete the object. However, It will populate the delete flag attribute with a value of 'true' on the object to indicate that the object is missing and/or deleted in the imported file. This allows the user to determine their own strategy for managing deletions, such as processing the deletions via a workflow. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Consider an example that a  file containing the Brand details is imported into the system and all Brands including their additional information are stored in the system under their respective hierarchy. The next time the same type of file is imported with some brand name deleted, the deleted Brand names are tracked as defined below.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Track  objects deleted during import</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an attribute  (or verify that one exists) with the validity set to the object type(s) that need to be tracked. In this example, an attribute 'Delete Status' is created with the validity set to object type Brand.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Within the Delta Calculation state of the  workflow, configure the newly created attribute  within the 'Delete status attribute' parameter. For more information on configuring the attribute in the workflow, see the topic <b>5. Update Delete Status Attribute and Delta Calculation Method in Import Workflows</b><MadCap:xref href="../../Quick Start Guide/Admin QSG/5. Update Delete Status Attribute and Delta Calculation Method in Import Workflows.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. In the example below, the attribute Delete Status  is configured within the Delta Calculation state in the AutoCare Brand Import workflow. Setting the Delete Status attribute in this state is what writes the value to the Delete flag.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Each workflow has a Delta calculation method where the importer evaluates the contents of the imported file to the contents in the database ('context' method), or against the previously loaded file of that type ('file' method) to remove unchanged objects (it will take failed imports and errors into account). While doing this it will collect all IDs in the current import file. However, the Delta Calculation to calculate the delete flag (regardless if 'file' or 'context' method is used) will go through the entire hierarchy in the database and see what is present in the database but not in the current file. The objects that are in the database but not in the import file will be added to the delete file and have the configured delete status attribute set to 'true.' For data that is determined to require deletion, the importer does not actually delete the data, but instead writes to the defined attribute that the data <i>should</i> be deleted. This allows each customer to determine their own strategy for managing deletions, such as processing the deletions via a workflow.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, the Brand import has a brand name '3M' deleted. Because the brand name '3M' is deleted in import file, the configured attribute Delete Status displays the value of 'true.'</p>
