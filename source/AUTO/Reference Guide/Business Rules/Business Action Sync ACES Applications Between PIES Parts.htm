        <h1>Business Action: Sync ACES Applications Between PIES Parts</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This rule is a business action found under the Automotive menu that will synchronize all ACES applications between two PIES Items by following a reference between the parts. </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This rule cannot be used to move applications outside of the AutoCare model (using PIES Item and ACES Application object types) as the functionality for construction of the application ID and other related data relies on the standard model.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The rule has a single parameter (Reference Type), which requires selection of a reference. For the rule to function properly, the selected reference must be a product reference with the PIES Item object type (ID=AC_PIESItem) as both the source and the target, and the rule must be set with the PIES Item as the valid object type.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The action evaluates all ACES applications that are child to the selected part on which the rule is being executed, and the applications on the target(s) of the reference indicated in the business rule configuration. The records are then synchronized between the parts, excluding duplicates. For example, assume Part A has 3 records and Part B has 2 records. One of the records on each part is a match to the other, meaning that all data for the application is identical, except the part number. Following the sync, both parts will have 4 records.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When a sync occurs, the applications are copied between the referenced parts with all data on the original records retained, except the part number. The part that the application is being applied to is written as the part number in both the application name and the hash function of the application ID, as well as within the ACES Replacement Context metadata value. The brand element of the replacement context is also updated if the part that the application is being moved to is from another brand (indicated by the value of the attribute with ID=AC_PIES_ITEMBrandAAIAID on the PIES Item).</p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">ACES supports only a single asset being linked to any application. If multiple assets are present on an application, all will be linked to the record being created by the sync, but only one will be accounted for in the application ID. This could lead to duplicate applications in the system so it is important to ensure that the standard is adhered to and only one asset is present for any application.</p>
