        <h1>Configuring the Copy Applications to Related Parts Business Action in Workbench</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The 'Copy applications to related parts' business operation is found within the STEP Workbench  Business Rule Editor under the Automotive menu  and does not offer additional parameters, but does require the use of the  reference type 'Part Relation.' Setup is required within both STEP Workbench and Web UI for the action to be available to users. This section addresses configuring the reference type and business action within the workbench.</p>
        <h2>Configuring the Reference Type </h2>
        <p class="Body1">Before the business action can be used within Web UI, the  reference type 'Part Relation' must be populated with one or more parts that relate to the selected part. If the business rule is run against an application using a part that has a blank Part Relation parameter, then no changes will occur. In the example below, parts VC21499 and VC36009 have part VC 36112 populated within the Part Relation reference type. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Configuring the Business Action</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Before the business action can be used within Web UI, the business action must be created. Below are the steps required to create the business action.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Create the business action with a name that accurately describes to the user what this action will do. The name of the business action displays within the Web UI and should be easy for the user to identify. For this example, the business action name is 'Copy Applications To Related Parts.'</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The business action Name will display to the Application Manager user once the Bulk Updates action button is selected. If more than one bulk update is configured, then the name displays both within the Bulk Applications Update dialog, and within the copy applications to related parts dialog where the user enters the part for the application (as shown in the example within the <b>Using the  Configured Copy Applications To Related Parts Business Action in Web UI</b> section of the <b>Business Action: Copy Applications To Related Parts</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Business Action Copy Applications to Related Parts.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref> within this guide). </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Edit the new business rule, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/click ellipsis button.flsnp" /> next  to the Valid Object Types parameter and select the valid object types for this business action. For this example, the 'ACES Application' object type is selected, however the TecDoc and NAPA applications can also be selected within the same or separate business actions. This decision is at the discretion of the administrator. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">On the Operations tab of the Business Rule Editor, click the <b>Add new Business Action</b> link, and click the edit button to open the Edit Operation dialog. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Use the dropdown menu within the Edit Operation dialog to select <b>Automotive</b> &gt; <b>Copy applications to related parts</b> operation, and the Save button will become active (as shown above).</li>
