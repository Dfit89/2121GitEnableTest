        <h1>Business Action: Move ACES Applications for PIES Part</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This rule is a business action found under the Automotive menu that will move all ACES applications from one PIES Item to another by following a reference between the parts. The rule has a single parameter (Reference Type), which requires selection of a reference. For the rule to function properly, the selected reference must be a product reference with the PIES Item object type (ID=AC_PIESItem) as both the source and the target, and the rule must be set with the PIES Item as the valid object type.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The action evaluates all ACES applications that are child to the selected part on which the rule is being executed and moves the child applications from the current object to the target(s) of the reference identified in the rule. If the PIES Item has no reference of this type, no action is taken and the existing applications will remain in place. If the PIES Item has one or multiple targets of the reference, the applications will be duplicated to all targets and removed from the source object. </p>
        <p class="Body1">When a move occurs, the application is moved with all data on the original record retained, except the part number. The part that the application is being moved to is applied as the part number in both the application name and the hash function of the application ID, as well as within the ACES Replacement Context metadata value. The brand element of the replacement context is also updated if the part that the application is being moved to is from another brand (indicated by the value of the attribute with ID=AC_PIES_ITEMBrandAAIAID on the PIES Item).</p>
        <p class="important1">ACES supports only a single asset being linked to any application. If multiple assets are present on an application, all will be linked to the moved record, but only one will be accounted for in the application ID. This could lead to duplicate applications in the system so it is important to ensure that the standard is adhered to and only one asset is present for any application.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Note that this rule cannot be used to move applications outside of the AutoCare model (using PIES Item and ACES Application object types) as the functionality for construction of the application ID and other related data relies on the standard model.</p>
