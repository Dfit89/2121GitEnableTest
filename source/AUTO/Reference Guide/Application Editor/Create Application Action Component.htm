        <h1>Create Application Action Component</h1>
        <p>The Create Application Action component enables users to create application records for the selected vehicle / assembly or part. Meaning that this component applicates the selected part to the vehicle / assembly or vice versa. This component is available as a toolbar action for Node Lists, and one common usage is within the Application Editor Screen.</p>
        <h2>Configuring the Create Application Action Component</h2>
        <p class="Body1">When Easy Setup actions  are used to create a standard data model, Create Application Action component is added in the Application Editor Screen by default. It is the ready-to-use component that allows users to create application records. Users can further configure this component to their requirements. Follow the steps described below to add and configure the Create Application Action component as a toolbar action on a Node List, or skip to step 3 to directly configure the available Create Application Action component.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, add the component. Under Child&#160;Components on the Node&#160;List Properties screen in the designer, click the <b>Add</b> button under the field for Actions parameter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Then select <b>Create Application Action</b> from the component list. Click <b>Add</b>.</li>

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Create Application Business Action</b>: This parameter lets users define a business rule that will be executed on all new applications. One example is to configure a business action that sets the STEP object Name of the newly created application records.

            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Icon Style Class</b>: This parameter allows a custom icon to be displayed on the action button.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Label</b>: To change the default button label, add the custom text to the Label field. If nothing is added, the Label default will display as 'Create.'</li>

Users can configure the faceted search to use all available attributes, IDs, or Names.

        <h2>Creating applications using Create Application Action </h2>
        <p>The central feature of the Application Editor Screen is the ability to create an application record on the selected vehicle / assembly or part (depending upon the type of Application Editor Screen). Follow the steps described below to create an application record for the selected part in a Application Editor Screen. The example in this document considers applicating the Part to the vehicle / assembly. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the part  that application records should be created for.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Application Editor Screen must be configured to display either as the Main Screen or as a Sub Screen Tab Page when the part is selected.</p>
        <p class="Body2">In this example, the part 'JK21499' is selected and the Application Editor Screen displays the existing application records belonging to that part.</p>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Editor/19.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click the <b>Create</b> button that is available in the toolbar of the screen and the Create Application dialog will be displayed as shown below:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Editor/17.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> In the above example, a regular Node Picker Dialog is displayed. However, the user can configure it to display the Faceted Search Dialog instead of  the regular node picker. For details on how to use the Faceted Search Dialog, see the <b>Faceted Search Dialog</b> documentation within this guide<MadCap:xref href="Faceted Search Dialog.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click on the Node Picker icon and select the vehicle / assembly that should be applicated to the selected part either by navigating through the standard Browse tab or by searching through the Search tab. In the example below, vehicle '1962 Abarth 1000' is selected. Click OK to close the Node Picker dialog.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Editor/20.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <b>OK</b> to close the Create Application dialog.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Editor/21.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The result is that the part 'JK21499' is applicated to vehicle '1962 Abarth 1000' and the application record 'JK21499 - Check Engine Light Sensor - 1962 Abarth 1000' is created and listed in the Application Editor Screen (as shown below).</p>
