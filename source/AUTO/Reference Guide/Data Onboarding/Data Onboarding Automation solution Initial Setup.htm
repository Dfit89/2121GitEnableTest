        <p> The Mapper Configuration is the STEP setup entity object, which holds the definition of what the mapper should do. After the Easy Setup action is run, a one-time initial setup is required before any Mapper Configurations can be created. A setup group must be created to hold the Mapper Configurations. This document  describes the  process of initial setup, which constitutes setting up the data model in  workbench.</p>
        <p class="Body1">By the end of this configuration in the workbench, a setup group called 'Mappings' is created where users can  add new Mapper Configurations. Further configuration of the  Mapper Configurations can be only done in the Web UI. For information on configuring Mapper configurations in the Web UI, see the  <b>Configuring Web UI for Data Onboarding Solution</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Configuring Web UI for Data Onboarding Solution.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;"> Running the Easy Setup action  creates the  <b>Mapper Configuration</b> object type under Basic Object Types hierarchy within System Setup tab as displayed in the screenshot below.</p>
        <p class="Image1">

        </p>
        <p>Below are the steps for an initial setup in the workbench.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to <b>System Setup</b> &gt; <b>Object Types &amp; Structures</b>, select then right-click the <b>Setup Group type root</b> node and select <b>New Object Type</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the dialog that appears, enter an ID in the ID parameter (e.g., MapperConfigurations), enter a Name in the Name parameter (e.g., Mapper Configurations), then click the <b>Create</b> button. This creates a setup group object type that will be used for the root node of the Mapper Configurations object to store all mapper configurations below.</p>
                <p>The sample below illustrates a hierarchy of setup group object types. A Setup Group named 'Mapper Configurations' has been created.</p>
                <p class="Image1">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/1.png" />
                </p>
                <p>Once the setup group is made, the 'Mapper Configurations' basic object type must be linked to this newly created node as a child. Later, when new Mapper Configurations are created and added to the system, they will use this object type.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to <b>Object Types &amp; Structures</b> &gt; <b>Basic Object Types</b> &gt; <b>Mapper Configuration</b>, and click the <b>References</b> tab.</p>
                <p>Under the <b>Parents</b> flipper, click <b>Add Parent</b>, and in the node selector dialog, specify the <b>Mapper Configurations</b> node that was created in the above step.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The next step is to create a new setup group root, where all Mapper Configurations will be stored below.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Creating a New Setup Group Root</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">To create the setup group root, navigate to <b>Maintain</b> (drop-down menu) &gt; <b>Insert</b> &gt; <b>Setup Group Root...</b>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Select the  'Mapper Configurations' object type.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Specify the <b>ID</b> and <b>Name</b> for the setup group root object. In this setup, ID and Name value of 'Mappings' is entered.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Click <span class="bold">Create</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/4.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The setup group called 'Mappings' of the object type 'Mapper Configurations' is created. From this newly created node, users can right-click and add new Mapper Configurations.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Starting with Product MDM for Automotive 9.1-MP1, creating a new Mapper Configuration can be done through the Web UI by clicking on 'Create <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-08-20T16:48:44.1892294+05:30" MadCap:creator="bond" MadCap:initials="BO" MadCap:comment="As per Nikki: There's no need to state that because this documentation is being released with STEP 9.2 and at this point, any automotive customer that is using the mapper will be on 9.2 have already seen the 'Create new global mapping' link. There currently aren't any customers aside from NGK that are using the mapper. They're all waiting for the documentation to be released."

        <p>The Mapper Configurations under the setup group 'Mappings' are stored in STEP as a setup entity that can be exported and imported as STEP &lt;Setup Entity&gt; objects. It cannot be imported through Excel.</p>
