        <h1>Use Cases - Copy Data from One Object to Child Object of Another Object</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Because the Object to Object mapping plugin within Onboarding Mappings Details screen has many uses for how the mappings can be configured,  describing the components within the mapper does not fully cover all of the functional use cases. With that in mind, two full use cases are described below that outline instances where this Object to Object Mapping plugin has been successfully implemented to copy data from one object to child object of another object.</p>
        <h2>Example One</h2>
        <p>For the ease of understanding in this topic, data is to be copied from AutoCare standard to our Own standard. The AutoCare Vehicle hierarchy creates multiple objects that are split up for Sub Models and Years below the Model object. In this example, the Model object in the AutoCare Vehicle hierarchy will be used to illustrate how you are able to create your Own Vehicle hierarchy that combines the Sub Model and Year into one object and store the Sub Model and Year as attribute values on that object. And, consideration has been given to use the Engine Base value from the AutoCare hierarchy in the ID and Name of the newly created objects in the Own Vehicle hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In this example, the AutoCare Audi 100 model is used as the Source object and take all Sub Models and Years below 100 model to create as new objects below the Own object (example Target Vehicle 100 hierarchy). Below is the image displaying  AutoCare hierarchy of Source object (Model).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Following are the detailed steps describing to achieve the same via the mapping solution.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC"><b>Prerequisites</b>
        </p>
        <p>Create a new Classification Reference Type and establish the reference between the AutoCare Audi model 100  and Own Target Vehicle 100  object.

        <p>In the Web UI, create and configure the Mapper Configuration and define the Source and Target objects and the Reference type to follow to determine the relationship between the Source and Target object.
