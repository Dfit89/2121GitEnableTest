        <h1>Using Onboarding Comparison Screen Interface</h1>
        <p>The Onboarding Comparison Screen interface is designed to allow users to  preview the onboarding data, assess each of the changes, and to give the user an option to accept or reject each individual changes that will affect the Target object. This allows users to distinguish and allow only the required changes to be Onboarded. This is accomplished by allowing users to select only the required Mapper rows / Mapping plugins across multiple Mapper rows / Mapping plugins per the configuration of the Mapper Configuration setup entity.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Each Onboarding Comparison Screen can be configured to display up to three Mapping stages. Because the final stage called as Confirm stage is set by default, there can be a maximum of four stages displayed in each Onboarding Comparison Screen. Within each Mapping stages, a checkbox is used to select valid Mapping plugins / Mapper rows.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Following are the Mapping stages that can be made available to be configured in the Onboarding Comparison Screen. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Application stage</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Attributes stage</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Objects stage</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Confirm stage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of all the stages mentioned above, the Confirm stage gets displayed only when any of the other three stages are available. And the Application stage, Attributes stage, and Objects stage are displayed when ALL of the following conditions are met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">One or more of the associated Mapping plugin is in the enabled state. And atleast one of the Mapper rows listed within these Mapping plugins are in the active state too. </li>
            <li class="Bullet1">The comparison Stage parameter that are available within the Onboarding Comparison Screen Properties designer screen is either empty or has the required stage listed in it. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">For example, if the Mapper Configuration  setup entity constitutes of only the Attribute Mapping plugin, then the Onboarding Comparison Screen configured to display the Mapper Configuration  setup entity will only display the Attribute stage and the Confirm stage. In the example below, because 'PIES Item --&gt; NAPA Product' Mapper Configuration  setup entity has only the Attribute Mapping Plugin, the Attributes stage and the Confirm stage are displayed  when Source object is selected (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/201.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Additionally, if the Object to Object Mapping plugin is added to the 'PIES Item --&gt; NAPA Product' Mapper Configuration setup entity, then the available stages display as Attribute stage, Object stage and the Confirm stage (as shown below).</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/202.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/203.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Additionally, consider being able to add the Application Mapping plugin for  'PIES Item --&gt; NAPA Product' Mapper Configuration  setup entity.  In the screenshot below, the available stages display as Attribute stage, Object stage, Application stage and the Confirm stage. </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/204.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/205.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The related stage gets displayed in the Onboarding Comparison Screen only when the respective Mapping plugins are available in the configured Mapper Configuration  setup entity. Similarly, only those Mapping plugins / Mapper rows that are in the active state are displayed within the Onboarding Comparison Screen. If there exists multiple Mapping plugins of the same type all in the disabled state, then the associated stage will not be displayed in the Onboarding Comparison Screen.  </p>
        <p class="Body1">For example, when the Source object is selected to display the Onboarding Comparison Screen, and the Attribute stage is selected to display, only those Mapper rows / Attribute Mapping plugins will be displayed that are enabled in the Mapper Configuration  setup entity. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Taking this example a step further, after selecting Source Object 'VC21499' for the Attribute stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen, and Mapper rows are enabled for the first row, users can easily view the enabled Mapper rows within Attribute stage (as shown below).</p>

        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Onboarding Comparison Screen have many configuration options. The Web UI administrator has control over the Stages that are allowed to be displayed within the Onboarding Comparison Screen. If your screen display differently than the examples within this section, contact your Web UI administrator.
