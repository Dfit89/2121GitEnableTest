        <h1>Executing Mapper Configuration Setup Entity</h1>
        <p class="Body1"> The Mapper Configuration Setup Entity can be  executed in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By executing through Mapper Action button (this is the recommended method in the Web UI as it will be faster)</li>
            <li>By executing through the Onboarding Comparison Screen <MadCap:xref href="Onboarding Comparison View/Onboarding Comparison Screen_in progress.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref></li>
            <li>By a background process with an automated import</li>
            <li>By configuring it in a business rule and executing the business rule on the source object</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p class="Body1">It is assumed that the admin user has knowledge of STEP administrative functions and experience working in
System Setup, including creating and editing business rules, workflows, and Web UIs. This section targets only the specific information
needed for a knowledgeable STEP admin user to execute the Mapper Configuration in different possible ways. For more  introductory material of these concepts, see the <b>Business Rules</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Business Rules/Business Rules.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref>, <b>Workflows</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Workflows/Workflows.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> and <b>Web User Interfaces</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Web UI Getting Started/Web User Interfaces.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> sections of <b>STEP Online Help</b>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Before any Mapper Configuration is executed, the relationship must be established through references between the Source object to the Target object.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Before any Mapper Configuration is e4xecuted, it is necessary that  the  configuration  aspects of the Data Onboarding solution in both the workbench and the  Web UI are completed.

        <h2>Executing Through Mapper Action Button</h2>
        <p class="Body1">This process involves defining an action button called <b>Mapper Action</b> to hold the Mapper Configuration setup entity, and configuring the action button in required screens. Clicking on the action button will initiate the Mapper Configuration  setup entity on the selected node.</p>
        <p class="Body1"> The <b>Mapper Action</b> button can be configured to be available within the Source object screen, or any other places that allows the action button to be executed (e.g., run as a bulk update on a Collection, or initiate the action button with a node selected in the Search by Card screen). For the ease of understanding, this document depicts an example of configuring the Mapper Action button in the Node Detail screen that is configured to view the Source object. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Following are the steps to configure the Mapper Action button.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">In the Web UI designer, navigate to the screen that requires the Mapper Action button to be configured &gt; Buttons &gt; go to component &gt; Button Properties.</li>

        <h2>Executing by Onboarding Comparison Screen</h2>
        <p class="Body1">This process involves configuring an Onboarding Comparison Screen  to hold the Mapper Configuration and then access this screen for the Source object through multiple ways. This type of execution provides an option for  the user to preview the changes affecting the Target object even before the data is onboarded. The Onboarding Comparison Screen allows users to assess each of the changes, and gives the user an option to accept or reject the changes that will affect the Target object. Additionally, this screen also provides users an option to exclude any Mapping plugin being executed for any required Source object on its subsequent import.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create and configure a Onboarding Comparison Screen. For the full set of instructions on configuring the Onboarding Comparison Screen, see the <b>Configuring Onboarding Comparison Screen</b> documentation.</li>
            <li>Review and implement the most common ways to use Onboarding Comparison Screen as described in <b>Using Onboarding Comparison Screen Interface</b> topic within this guide.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Execute the Mapper Configuration  setup entity through Onboarding Comparison Screen as described in <b>xxxxx</b> topic.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Executing by a Background Process</h2>
        <p class="Body1">This method of execution is also considered as the automatic onboarding method. This process involves creating a new state in the Import workflow to hold a Mapper Configuration setup entity that gets automatically executed whenever there is a new import. After the file is imported in the system, the  Onboarding background process runs a drill down search for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">To identify <i>all</i> the <b>Source objects</b> in the system that has the change flag attribute value set to 'true.' The change flag attribute is configured in the 'Changed attribute' parameter (explained below). The Source object(s) belong to the object type configured in the 'Source' parameter that is available   within the 'Setup' tab of the Onboarding Mappings Details screen for the selected Mapper Configuration setup entity (an example shown below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When executing through this method, the background process executes the Mapper Configuration setup entity on  <i>every source objects residing in the system</i> that has the change flag attribute value set to 'true.' <i>Not</i> just the source objects in the importing file.</p>
        <p class="Image3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/220.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">To identify the <b>Reference type</b> configured in the 'Reference' parameter which is available within the 'Setup' tab of the Onboarding Mappings Details screen for the selected Mapper Configuration setup entity (an example shown below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Image3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/221.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">To identify the <b>Target object</b> belonging to the object type configured in the 'Target' parameter which is available within the 'Setup' tab of the Onboarding Mappings Details screen for the selected Mapper Configuration setup entity (an example shown below). If the Target object does not exist to run the Mapper Configuration on, then it can be made possible to create a Target object based on the condition defined in the 'Target Hierarchy' Parameter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Image3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/222.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Once the  Onboarding background process identifies the Source object, Target object, and the reference linking the Source object with the Target object, then the Mapper Configuration  setup entity will be executed only on the identified results. This way, Onboarding background process eliminates execution of the Mapper Configuration on all other objects in the system than those that actually requires to be updated.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To execute the Mapper Configuration by a background process, the following configuration is needed:</p>
        <p class="Body1"> These levels of configuration are explained in detail below. For more information on creating / editing the business action and workflows, see the <b>Business Action</b> section<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Business Rules/Actions/Business Actions.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref>, and the <b>Workflows</b> section<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Workflows/Workflows.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> of the <b>STEP Online Help</b>.</p>
        <h3>Configuring the Onboarding state to execute Mapper Configuration setup entity in the Workflow</h3>
        <p class="Body1"> The Mapper Configuration setup entity <i>cannot</i> be executed on any exiting state in the workflow. To achieve this, a new state after the Import state needs to be  created, and a business action that triggers a background process to execute the Mapper Configuration setup entity is added to the newly created onboarding state in the import workflow. Below are the steps to create and update a workflow to execute the Mapper Configuration setup entity.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Go to System Setup &gt; Workflows &gt; Select the workflow used by the importer. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Bullet1NextPara">For this example,  AutoCare PIES Import workflow is used.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Right-click the respective workflow, select <b>Edit STEP Workflow</b>, and the STEP Workflow Designer will display.</li>

        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;"> Users <i>cannot</i> create multiple local actions to execute multiple Mapper Configuration setup entity in one single state. If multiple Mapper Configuration setup entity is to be executed,  then the user has to create multiple onboarding states for each Mapper Configuration setup entity that is to be executed. </p>
        <h3>Monitoring the automated Onboarding process</h3>
        <p>Monitoring an Onboarding process allows users to view the onboarding process' activity and status, and analyze the execution report for details. </p>
        <p>Each onboarding state can have only one business action (Run background process action). For executing multiple Mapper Configuration setup entity, user has to create multiple onboarding states for each Mapper Configuration setup entity. Presence of multiple onboarding states allows each business actions within them to run as individual background processes and they all shares the common background process service (MapperBackgroundService). </p>
        <p class="Body1">As the file is uploaded for an import in the Web UI, the Controller Entity moves through their associated Import workflow. Users can monitor the progress using their  associated Status Selector Widget on the Web UI homepage and/or the left side panel. Clicking the Controller icon displays the Import Details below the Controller list. For information on how to access the Import Details screen, see the associated importer topics under the <b>Importing Automotive Data</b> section<MadCap:xref href="../Importers/Importing Automotive Data.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When the Controller reaches the Onboarding state in the workflow and executes the  Mapper Configuration setup entity on all the Source objects with Changed attribute value = true, a background process (BGP) will be generated. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">and the</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">a corresponding BGP folder is created on the application server at /workarea/background-processarea/MappingBackgroungService directory.</MadCap:conditionalText>Additionally, the Background Process Link column displays a link to the Background Process Details screen as 'waiting.'</p>

        <p>Following are the BGP Log output considerations for the automated onboarding process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Progress of the objects updated is reported per 100 updated objects</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Any direct failure to onboard an object is reported as an exception (this does not stop onboarding of remaining objects)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Executing by a Business Rule</h2>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This is an outdated method that is still being used for execution in Web UI. Users are suggested to use the Mapper Action button instead (as detailed above in this topic).</p>
        <p class="Body1">This process involves configuring a business action  to hold the Mapper Configuration and run this business action on the source object in different possible ways. The execution can occur with a business action inside a workflow, or run on approving the object, or any other places that can run a business action (e.g., run as a bulk update on a Collection, or initiating the business action while a node is selected in Web UI).</p>

            <li>Create and configure a business action using the 'Execute mapper configuration' operation.
