        <h1>Removing Existing Part Number References</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: BOND PRODOC- 1515</p>
        <p class="Body1"> Users can remove an existing competitor and/or OE part number reference from a selected part within Web UI. When the Part Number References component is configured, and a part is selected,  a remove   button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) displays to the right of each OE Number / Competitor Number. Clicking the remove (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)&#160;button  will  remove the OE Number / Competitor Number reference from the Part Number References list, and therefore the number will no longer display within the list.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, part '90069' is selected within the Web UI Tree, and an 'OE Numbers' tab is configured to display results for 'Existing OE Part Number References.' Within the results, two Make / Manufacturer part numbers are displayed along with the remove (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)  buttons that allow users to remove the part number reference from the selected part.</p>

        <p class="Body1">Clicking the remove (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) button&#160;to the right of the 'Fiat 60815616' part number removes the part number reference and the part number no longer displays within the Existing OE Part Number Reference grid (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p>If an OE Number / Competitor part number is removed from the Part  Number References list, and it previously displayed within the Part Number Suggestions list, then the unlinked OE Number / Competitor part number  will display within the suggestions list. However, if the removed part number was not previously displayed within the suggestions list (i.e., manually added), then it will not display within the suggestions list.</p>
