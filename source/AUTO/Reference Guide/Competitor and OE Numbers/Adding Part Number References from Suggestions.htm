        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU and BOND PRODOC- 1514</p>
        <p class="Body1">Users can  add an existing competitor and/or OE part number reference to a selected part from the Part Number Suggestions list within Web UI. When the Part Number References and the Part  Number Suggestions components are configured, and a part is selected, STEP looks at the configured Reference Types and along with displaying their targets, attribute values, and/or metadata via configurations, it also suggests potential part numbers as suggestions within the configured Node Editor component.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When any OE Number / Competitor Number is displayed in the  Part  Number Suggestions list, an add button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/43.png" class="img_intext" />) displays alongside each OE Number / Competitor Number. Clicking the add button will add an OE Number / Competitor Number to the Part Number References list. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Clicking the remove button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)  will  remove the OE Number / Competitor Number reference from the Part Number References list / Part Number Suggestions list.  For more information, see the <b style="font-weight: bold;">Removing Existing Part Number References</b><MadCap:xref href="Removing Existing Part Number References.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> and the  <b>Removing Part Number Reference Suggestions</b> topics<MadCap:xref href="Removing Part Number Reference Suggestions.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this section.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, part '90069' is selected within the Web UI Tree, and the 'Competitor Numbers' tab is configured to display results for 'Existing Competitor Part Number References' and 'Competitor Part Number Suggestions.' Within the  Competitor Part Number Suggestions list, two Manufacturer part numbers display along with the (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/43.png" class="img_intext" />) buttons.</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/40.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Clicking the (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/43.png" class="img_intext" />) button to the right of the 'FEBIBILSTEIN 19730' suggestions list will add the 'FEBIBILSTEIN 19730' part to the Existing Competitor Part Number References list (as shown below).</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/41.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the part number reference to the selected part is created and now displays within the Part Number References table, the OE Number / Competitor part number  will no longer display within the     Part  Number Suggestions list.</p>
