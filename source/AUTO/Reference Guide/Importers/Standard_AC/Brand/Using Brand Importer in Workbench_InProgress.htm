        <p>The intention of the Brand importer of the automotive solution is to provide an out-of-the-box solution for importing data included within the Brand file.</p>
        <p>This section provides details on using  workbench to import Brand files. For a detailed explanation on  input file types and  output appearances, see the <b>Using Brand Importer in Web UI</b>  topic within this documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Reference Guide/Importers/Standard_AC/Brand/Using Brand Importer in Web UI_InProgress.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>When an import file is placed in a hotfolder, manually a background process is initiated and creates an entity in STEP that represents the file. This entity object is called the 'controller' and contains basic data about the file and the file's status in the workflow.</p>
        <p>The background process service that runs as part of the import state allows for the selection of business rules that function in the same way as rules that run as part of a standard import, meaning that they act on the objects being imported.</p>
        <h2>Importing a Brand File In STEP Workbench</h2>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Place the Brand file on an application server in a relevant hotfolder which is configured in the <b>AutoCare Brand Inbound Endpoint</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyIndentImage">For example: for windows system the hotfolder might look like /upload/hotfolders/AutoCareBrandInputFolder</p>

            <li>Upon placing the file, based on the invoke time scheduled, a background process will  start, and an entity object called the 'controller' is created.</li>

        <p>Once created, the controller is initiated into the workflow associated with the importer. From there, the workflow takes over processing of the file via a series of states using business rules and background processes to carry out the processing of the file.</p>
        <p>Each import has an associated workflow and all proceed through the same states by default. However, it is intended that customers will expand on the existing states and actions to add their own validations, reporting, and additional processing as needed.</p>
