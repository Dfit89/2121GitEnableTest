        <p>The intention of the PCdb importer for the automotive solution is to provide an out-of-the-box solution for importing data included within the PCdb file.</p>
        <p>This section provides details on using  workbench to import PCdb files. For a detailed explanation on  input file types and  output appearances, see the <b>Using PCdb Importer in Web UI</b>  topic within this documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Reference Guide/Importers/Standard_AC/PCdb/Using PCdb Importer in Web UI_InProgress.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>When an import file is placed in a hotfolder, manually a background process is initiated and creates an entity in STEP that represents the file. This entity object is called the 'controller' and contains basic data about the file and the file's status in the workflow.</p>
        <p>The background process service that runs as part of the Import state allows for the selection of business rules that function in the same way as rules that run as part of a standard import, meaning that they act on the objects being imported.</p>
        <h2>Importing a PCdb file in Workbench</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>	Place the PCdb file in the application server in the relevant hotfolder which is configured in the <b>AutoCare PCdb Inbound Endpoint</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, for a windows system the hotfolder might look like: /upload/hotfolders/AutoCarePCdbInputFolder</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Upon placing the file,  a background process will be started and an entity object called the 'controller' will be created based on the invoke time scheduled.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>For more information about Schedule Endpoints, see the <b>Configuring a PCdb Importer in Workbench</b> topic in this documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Reference Guide/Importers/Standard_AC/PCdb/Configuring a PCdb Importer in Workbench_InProgress.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>The entity moves through various states of the workflow, as a series of background processes handle the various processing and import activities.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>For more information on workflow states, see the <b>Import Workflow Overview</b> topic within the  <b>Automotive</b> section of the <b>Solution Enablement</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Quick Start Guide/User QSG/Importers/Import Workflow Overview.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Once created, the controller is initiated into the workflow associated with the importer. From there, the workflow takes over processing of the file via a series of states using business rules and background processes to carry out the processing of the file.</p>
        <p>Each import has an associated workflow and all proceed through the same states by default. However, it is intended that customers will expand on the existing states and actions to add their own validations, reporting, and additional processing as needed.</p>
        <p>For more information on validation rules, see the <b>PCdb Import Validation Rules</b> topic in this documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Reference Guide/Importers/Standard_AC/PCdb/PCdb Import Validation Rules.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>4.	Navigate to the 'Ready for Import' state in the 'Autocare PCdb Import' workflow.</p>
        <p>5.	Select the controller, with the 'Start Import' option selected in the dropdown. Click on the 'Submit' button, and the file will be imported successfully.</p>
