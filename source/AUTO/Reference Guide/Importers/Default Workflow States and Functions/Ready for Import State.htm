        <h1>Ready for Import State</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When a file has successfully completed validation, conversion, and delta calculation, the controller object is available in the Ready for Import state, which is the first state in which user interaction is required for successful files. If customer-specific reporting has been added to the implementation, it is likely that reports can be viewed in this state. Whether or not reporting has been added, the Ready for Import state is where the user must decide whether to import or reject the file. If the user rejects the file, it will be moved to the Rejected state via the Reject transition, which contains a single business rule to set the overall status of the controller entity. If the user chooses to import the file, it is moved to the Import state.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Only controller objects with files that have failed a previous process will end up in the Error state. It is also possible for files to have warnings and/or errors and still continue successfully through the process so it is important for users to view the data provided in the background processes in the Web UI to determine whether or not a file should be imported.</p>
