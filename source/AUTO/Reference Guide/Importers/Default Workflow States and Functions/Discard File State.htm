        <h1>Discard File State</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When a controller enters the Discard File state, it is automatically removed from the workflow via a business rule running on entry to the state. This means that information about the file and processing of it is no longer visible in Web UI workflow screens, though the controller entity itself still exists in STEP. Customers should consider if they would like additional "clean up" actions to occur at this point, such as deleting the entity in STEP and/or deleting  the generated files or background processes from the application server.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Clicking the <b>Discard file</b> button will cause the Discard file dialog (shown below) to display at the top of the screen. A user must click the 'X' in the top right of the dialog to close it.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Properties can be set in the sharedconfig.properties file on the application server to manage auto-deletion of the background processes. This is done using the format: <b>AutoDeleteBackgroundProcesses.AgeInHours.[Service] = [hours]</b>. Note that deletion of the background processes will remove the end user's ability to view warnings and errors for the processes in the Web UI. It is recommended to set up auto-deletion, but care should be taken to set the timing to an appropriate value for the end user processes.</p>
        <p>For example, to set the AutoCare validation processes to delete after 48 hours, specify: </p><pre>AutoDeleteBackgroundProcesses.AgeInHours.AutoCareValidationService = 48</pre>
