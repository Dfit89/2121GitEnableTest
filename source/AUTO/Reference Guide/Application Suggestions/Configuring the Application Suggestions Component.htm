        <h1>Configuring the Application Suggestions Component</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Application Suggestions component is a Node Editor component, often used along with the Part Application Editor component, to display potential applications listed as suggestions. The Application Suggestions component displays the suggestion list based on the configured reference types and  <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-02-06T17:32:37.2946003+05:30" MadCap:creator="bond" MadCap:initials="BO" MadCap:comment="The word 'Plugin' is used as the name of the parameter, and is used in many instances across Automotive components. Thus, the word 'Plugin' shall be retained in accordance."

        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Below are steps to configure the Application Suggestions component within a Node Editor. Each of the parameters for the Application Suggestions Properties are described below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Web UI Designer, go to Node Editor Properties &gt; Child Components &gt; Rows parameter for the screen that needs to display application record suggestions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/97.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button, and the Add Component dialog will display.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Suggestions/9.png" />
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Select the Application Suggestions component, click <b>Add</b>, and the  newly added component will display within the Rows parameter. In the screenshot below, the Application Suggestions component is configured along with the Part Application Editor and Headline components.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Suggestions/13.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Double click the newly added component available in the Rows parameter, and the Application Suggestions Properties dialog will display (as shown below). Parameter options are explained below:</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Suggestions/15.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Height:</b>This optional parameter specifies the visual height of the Advanced Part Number Suggestions component  in pixels. By default, this parameter is pre-populated with a value '400.' Users can enter a numeric value to alter height of the component.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Attribute <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-06-27T00:53:33.6560963+05:30" MadCap:creator="bond" MadCap:initials="BO" MadCap:comment="Suggest Sujay to change the help text of this parameter" MadCap:editor="bond" MadCap:editDate="2019-06-27T00:53:59.6316715+05:30">Group</MadCap:annotation>:</b>This optional parameter, when configured with an attribute group, sets up an additional unique <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-06-27T00:34:31.3589221+05:30" MadCap:creator="bond" MadCap:initials="BO" MadCap:comment="Or criteria?" MadCap:editor="bond" MadCap:editDate="2019-06-27T00:34:42.8518142+05:30">condition</MadCap:annotation> for the suggested application records. An attribute group which is valid for the application records can be configured. For example, consider there are two application records with the same   reference target to the Part Type and the Vehicle. Then the attribute values present within this attribute group determines the uniqueness of the application records. If both the application records has the same attribute values, then the system will suggest  as one single potential application record. If any one of the attribute values differs for the application records, then the system would suggest as two different potential application records. </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> The Node List component defined within this parameter displays the suggested application records information in a table / grid format. The view can be further customized by configuring the data to display via different display modes and adding different action buttons that users can click while working with the application records information. The display modes can then be customized with a range of headers, allowing for different information about the listed objects to be displayed. The behavior of many of the various actions can also be further configured.
