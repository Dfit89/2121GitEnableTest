        <h1>Removing Application from Suggestions List</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: BOND PRODOC- 1817</p>
        <p class="Body1"> Users can remove the suggested application record from the suggested list for a selected part within Web UI. When the Application Suggestions component is configured and an application record is selected within the suggested application list,  a <b>Remove</b> button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)   displays at the component tool bar. Clicking the <b>Remove</b> button will remove the suggested application record  from the Suggested Applications list, and therefore, the application record will no longer display within the list.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, part 'VC36115' is selected within the Web UI Tree, and the 'Application Suggestions' tab is configured to display results for 'Existing Applications' and 'Suggested Applications.' Within the results, in the 'Suggested Applications' list, four application records are displayed. An application record '2013 Chevrolet Orlando' is selected which activates and displays <b>Remove</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) button thereby allowing users to remove an application record for the selected part.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example, after removing the application record '2013 Chevrolet Orlando' from part 'VC36115' the Suggested Applications list displays as shown below.</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Application Suggestions/6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If the application record is removed from the Suggested Applications list, then the unlinked application record will no longer display within the     Suggested Applications  list.</p>
