        <h1>Removing Existing Applications</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: BOND PRODOC- 1817</p>
        <p class="Body1"> Users can remove an existing application record for a selected part within Web UI. When the Part Application Editor component is configured, and an application record is selected within the Existing Applications list,  a <b>Delete</b>   button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) displays at the component toolbar. Clicking the <b>Delete</b> button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)&#160;  will  delete the application record for the selected part, and therefore, the application record will no longer display within the list.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, part 'VC36115' is selected within the Web UI Tree, and an 'Applications Suggestions' tab is configured to display results for 'Existing Applications.' Within the results, two application records are displayed. An application record 'VC36115 2013 Volvo V40 Cross Country' is selected which activates and displays <b>Delete</b> (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) button thereby allowing users to remove that application record from the selected part.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Clicking the Delete (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) button&#160;at the component toolbar deletes the application record and the application record no longer displays within the Existing Applications grid (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p>If an application record is removed from the Existing Applications list, and it previously displayed within the Suggested Applications list, then the deleted application record will display within the suggestions list. However, if the removed application record was not previously displayed within the suggestions list (i.e., manually added), then it will not display within the suggestions list.</p>
