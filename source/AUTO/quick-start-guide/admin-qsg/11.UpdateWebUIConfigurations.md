11. Update Web UI Configurations
================================

While not strictly required, it may be helpful to update some elements
of the Web UI that are created by Easy Setup during setup action 2
(Configure import process) and 4 (Configure Web UI) for any standard
that includes creation of screens in the Web UI. Some of these screens
are ready to be used as-is, while others are considered a starting point
only, and require additional work to complete the setup.

This section describes the following changes that may be helpful to
apply in the Web UI:

-   Adding Additional Headers to Application Screens
    ([here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"})
-   Adjusting Homepage Import Status Selectors ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Displaying the Import Details Report Column ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Accessing Application Editor Manager Screens ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Allowing Applications Outside Part Type ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
