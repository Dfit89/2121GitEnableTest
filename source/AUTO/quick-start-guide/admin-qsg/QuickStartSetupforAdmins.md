Quick Start Setup for Admins
============================

This section addresses the necessary actions an admin user must take to
set up the automotive solution.

Prerequisites

It is assumed that the admin user has knowledge of STEP administrative
functions and experience working in System Setup, including creating and
editing workflows, business rules, Web UIs, attributes, etc. Therefore,
this guide does not provide introductory material for these concepts and
instead targets only the specific information needed for a knowledgeable
STEP admin user to complete the Automotive solution setup. If additional
information is needed, see the **STEP Online Help**.

This guide will often use the AutoCare standard as an example, but the
same information is applicable for the NAPA and TecDoc standards.
