Automotive Quick Start Guide Introduction
=========================================

This guide provides an introduction to the Product MDM (PMDM)Â for
Automotive solution available in STEP 8.2 and later versions. It covers
the necessary actions an admin user must take to set up the solution, as
well as providing an overview of the end user functionality that is
provided with the solution after Easy Setup actions for one or more
automotive standards have been completed by an admin.

The PMDM for Automotive solution supports the AutoCare, TecDoc, and NAPA
standard formats. The standards are individually licensed, so you will
not be able to access all of them on a system unless the specific
license has been applied. To purchase licenses for additional standards,
contact your Stibo Systems account manager.

The setup and end user functionalities are the same, regardless of the
standard being applied. This guide will often use the AutoCare standard
as an example, but the same information is applicable for the NAPA and
TecDoc standards.

Setup and use of application editing and mapping functionalities are
considered advanced functions that are outside the scope of this guide.
In addition, details on the specific data models for each standard are
not covered in this guide.
