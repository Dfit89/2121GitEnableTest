Quick Start for Users
=====================

This section provides an overview of end user functionality that is
provided with the solution after Easy Setup actions for one or more
automotive standards have been completed by an admin.

This section addresses the following topics:

-   Using Automotive Importers ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})
-   Using Automotive Exporters ([here]{.mcFormatColor
    style="color: Blue;"})

Prerequisites

This guide assumes that the reader has had some degree of STEP training
and is able to perform basic navigation and data maintenance tasks in
the STEP Web UI. Additional introductory material is provided in **STEP
Online Help**, if needed.

This guide will often use the AutoCare standard as an example, but the
same information is applicable for the NAPA and TecDoc standards.
