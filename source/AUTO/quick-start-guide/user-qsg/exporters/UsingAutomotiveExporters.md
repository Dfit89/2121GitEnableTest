Using Automotive Exporters
==========================

PRODOC note: MEDU Per KRMA - 1- Give a brief overview of how to access
and run each of the listed exporters and what the export results are. 2-
Specific parameters or functions should be described only if they are
non-standard or not self-explanatory, e.g., object selected in a PIES
import will result in any child (if blue) or linked (if yellow) PIES
products being exported. And discuss default vs. own model config.
Everything else should not need written explanation.

This topic serves as an overview of how each of the available Automotive
exporters are used, and how to access them.

For information on the supported versions, see the **Supported Versions
and Formats** topic[ here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.
