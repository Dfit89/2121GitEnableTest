        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Configuration Steps</p>
        <p class="Body1">Below are steps to configure the Advanced Part Number Suggestions component within a Node Editor. Each of the parameters for the Advanced Part Number Suggestions Properties are described below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Web UI the Designer, go to Node Editor Properties &gt; Child Components &gt; Rows parameter for the screen that needs to display part number suggestions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button, and the Add Component dialog will <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-02-06T15:03:21.6781134-05:00" MadCap:creator="lato" MadCap:initials="LA" MadCap:comment="add pic- again, I know that you are kind of doing it the step 4 pic, but I'd almost break that picture up...as in, I feel you are shoing steps 1-4 all in the one screenshot.

(just my suggestion....don't feel you have to follow my suggestion).\r\n\r\nBOND:Suggestion followed :)" MadCap:editor="bond" MadCap:editDate="2019-02-28T16:45:43.1865684+05:30">display</MadCap:annotation>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/99.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select the Advanced Part Number Suggestions component, click <b>Add</b>, and the Advanced Part Number Suggestions Properties dialog will display. Parameter options are explained below:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/100.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Height:</b>This optional parameter specifies the visual height of the Advanced Part Number Suggestions component  in pixels. By default, this parameter is pre-populated with a value '400.' Users can enter a numeric value to alter height of the component.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Reference Types:</b> By default, this required parameter is blank. However, it is mandatory to add at least one Product Reference Type so that when a part is selected, STEP can follow the reference types listed within this parameter and directly display  the target and/or  targets related information  based on the plugins configured in the Suggestion Plugins parameter. Some examples are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Within the AutoCare solution, when a part is selected STEP would need to follow the <b>PIES Interchange</b> reference and display the target and/or  targets related information.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Within the NAPA solution, when a part is selected STEP would need to follow the <b>Product to Interchange Product</b> reference and display the target and/or  targets related information.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Within the TecDoc solution, when a part is selected STEP would need to either follow the <b>Supplier Article to Competitor Number</b> and/or the <b>Supplier Article to OE Number</b> reference and display the target and/or  targets related to the selected reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button, the Advanced Part Number Suggestions Properties dialog will close, and the newly added component will display within the Rows parameter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/101.png" />
        </p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Double click the newly added Advanced Part Number Suggestions component, and the Advanced Part Number Suggestions Properties will display as shown below.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/84.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> The Node List component defined within this parameter displays the competitor and/or OE number information in a table / grid format. The view can be further customized by configuring the data to display via different display modes and adding different action buttons that users can click while working with the competitor and/or OE number information. The display modes can then be customized with a range of headers, allowing for different information about the listed objects to be displayed. The behavior of many of the various actions can be further configured, also. For more information, see the <b>Node List Component</b> topic within the <b>Web User Interfaces</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Node List Component.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Suggestion Plugins:</b> By default, this required parameter is pre-populated with the Same Number plugin. Optionally, a user can add one or more plugins by clicking  the <b>Add</b> button. It is mandatory to have at least one plugin so that when a part is selected, information about the suggested competitor and/or OE number can be displayed.</p>
        <p class="Image2">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/25.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body3">The Suggestion Plugins options are the following:</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Common applications:</b> This plugin is used to suggest other part numbers that have the same applications as the current part number.  Additional configuration parameters are not available for this plugin.</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Common number:</b> This plugin  suggests  other part number(s) that are referencing the same part number (or Competitor Number or OE Number) as the currently selected part number does. In other words, if the current part refers to a part number (OE Number / Competitor Number) that is referenced by another part number (OE Number / Competitor Number), then the other part number is suggested via this plugin. For example, if two different parts 'JK21499' and 'JK36004' are referenced to a part 'GL26409', then part 'JK36004' is suggested in the Part Number Suggestions component when part 'JK21499' is selected.</p>
        <p class="Body3">Double click on the plugin name in the Suggestions Plugins parameter to further configure the plugin.</p>
        <p class="Body3">

        <ul>
            <li class="Numbered2"><b>Reference Types:</b> By default, this required parameter is blank. However, it is mandatory to add at least one Product Reference Type so that when a part is selected, the reference types listed within this parameter are followed and display the target and/or related competitor and/or OE number information on the targets. </li>

Setting the Max Chain Size to 2 would mean that information from the last reference in the chain will not be displayed." MadCap:editor="bond" MadCap:editDate="2019-01-24T15:23:15.1722318+05:30">Types</MadCap:annotation>. For example, If the value '4' is entered against the Max Chain Size parameter, then the maximum chain links of references that the STEP looks to suggest as potential Part Number / OE Numbers / Competitor Number   is four.</li>
            <li class="Numbered2"><b>Reference Types:</b> By default, this required parameter is blank. However, it is mandatory to add at least one Product Reference Type. When a part is selected, the reference types listed within this parameter are followed, and the target and/or related competitor and/or OE number information on the targets are displayed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body3"> For example, consider there are six different parts 'JK21499', 'JK36004', 'JK36009', 'JK36112', 'VC21499' and  'VC36004' interlinked in a manner, 'JK21499' is referenced by 'JK36004', 'JK36004' is referenced by 'JK36009', 'JK36009' is referenced by 'JK36112',  'JK36112' is referenced by 'VC21499' and 'VC21499' is referenced by 'VC36004'. Assuming that the Max Chain Size value as '4' and all the references connecting these parts are listed within the Reference Types parameter, the Part Number Suggestions component would suggest only the parts 'JK36004', 'JK36009', 'JK36112' and 'VC21499' when the part 'JK21499' is selected.</p>
        <p class="Body3"><b>Same Number:</b> This plugin is used to suggest other part numbers based upon matching part number names used in the Part Number Suggestions component. Additional configuration parameters are not available for this plugin. However, customers with the Extension API license can create their own plugins. For more information, click the STEP&#160;API Documentation button on the Start Page, or contact your Stibo Systems representative.</p>
