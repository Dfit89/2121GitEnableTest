        <p class="Body1"> Users can remove an existing competitor and/or OE part number reference suggestions from a selected part within Web UI. When the Part  Number Suggestions component is configured, and a part is selected,  a remove button (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />)  button displays to the right of each OE Number / Competitor Number. Clicking the remove button will remove the OE Number / Competitor Number reference from the Part Number Suggestions list, and therefore the number will no longer display within the list.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, part '90069' is selected within the Web UI Tree, and the 'Competitor Numbers' tab is configured to display results for 'Existing Competitor Part Number References' and 'Competitor Part Number Suggestions.' Within the results, in the 'Competitor Part Number Suggestions list, two Make / Manufacturer part numbers are displayed along with the  remove (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Competitor OE Number/51.png" class="img_intext" />) button that allows users to remove a part number reference of a suggested part number from the selected part.</p>

        <p class="Body1">In the example, after removing the reference of part number 'MAPCO 19370' from part '90069' the Competitor Part Number Suggestions list displays as shown below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the Part Number is removed from the Part  Number Suggestions list, then the unlinked OE Number / Competitor part number  will no longer display within the     Part  Number Suggestions list.</p>
