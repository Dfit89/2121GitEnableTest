        <ol>
            <li>Using the Designer, go to Node Editor Properties Child Components for the screen that needs to display part number suggestions. </li>
            <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button for the Child Components Rows parameter, and the Add Component dialog will display.</li>
            <li>Search for and select the Part Number Suggestions component.</li>

Optionally edit these components, and/or add additional Headers components to display information about the suggested competitor and/or OE number. </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Reference Types:</b> By default, this required parameter is blank. However, it is mandatory to add at least one Product Reference Type so that when a part is selected, STEP can follow the reference types listed within this parameter and directly display  the targets and/or  target related information  based on the plugins configured in the Suggestion Plugins parameter.</p>

Assuming that the Max Chain Size value as '4' and all the references connecting these parts are listed within the Reference Types parameter, the Part Number Suggestions component would suggest the parts 'JK36004', 'JK36009', 'JK36112' and 'VC21499' when the part 'JK21499' is selected.</p>
