        <h1>Configuring the Copy Application to Other Part Business Action in Workbench</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The 'Copy application to other part' business operation is found within the STEP Workbench  Business Rule Editor under the Automotive menu and requires population of a single parameter (Copy application to other part parameter key). However, setup is required within both STEP Workbench and Web UI for the action to be available to users. This section addresses the steps necessary within the workbench.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Create the business action with a name that accurately describes to the user what this action will do. The name of the business action displays within the Web UI and should be easy for the user to identify. For this example, the business action name is 'Copy Application To Other Part.'</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The business action Name will display to the Application Manager user once the Bulk Updates action button is selected. If more than one bulk update is configured, then the name displays both within the Bulk Applications Update dialog, and within the change part dialog where the user enters the part for the application (as shown in the example within the <b>Using the  Configured Copy Application To Other Part Business Action in Web UI</b> section of the <b>Business Action: Copy Application To Other Part</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Business Action Copy Application to Other Part.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>). </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Edit the new business rule, <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/click ellipsis button.flsnp" /> next  to the Valid Object Types parameter and select the valid object types for this business action. For this example, the 'ACES Application' object type is selected, however the TecDoc and NAPA applications can also be selected within the same or separate business actions. This decision is at the discretion of the administrator. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">On the Operations tab of the Business Rule Editor, click the <b>Add new Business Action</b> link, and click the edit button to open the Edit Operation dialog. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Use the dropdown menu within the Edit Operation dialog to select <b>Automotive</b> &gt; <b>Copy application to other part</b> operation, and the following parameters   will display (as shown above):<ul MadCap:continue="true"><li class="Numbered1"><b>Ignore Part Type:</b> By default, this optional parameter is disabled. This  parameter gives an option to check for a part type or not before copying an application for a part. If unchecked, then trying to copy an application to another part that does not have the same part type will fail. If checked, User can copy an application to a part of same and / or different part type.</li><li class="Numbered1"><b>Copy application to other part parameter key:</b> By default, this required parameter is blank. Within the parameter enter a unique way (key) to identify this  rule. Uniqueness is the only restriction for this key. It will not be displayed to the user. It is case sensitive.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="important2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Common setup is to copy the key so it can be pasted in the Web UI designer when configuring the  business action in Web UI. </p>
