        <h1>Business Action: Copy Applications to Related Parts</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This automotive business action allows users to copy one or more existing applications to one or more related parts by clicking a Bulk Updates action button within an Application Manager.  However, it cannot copy the part of a missing application, and thus any missing applications selected when the bulk update is run will be ignored. For more information, see the <b>Missing Application Coverage Functionality</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Application Manager/Missing Application Coverage Functionality.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide. Setup is required within both STEP Workbench and Web UI for the action to be available to users.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Once configured, a Bulk Updates button within an Application Manager can be used to copy  one or more existing applications to one or more related parts based upon the population of the Part Relation reference type. To understand the results of the business action, it is important to understand a Part Relation reference type configuration. This section will first review a Part Relation reference type configuration, and then provide the steps for using the business action in Web UI.</p>
        <h3>Part Relation Reference Type Configuration</h3>
        <p class="Body1">When  the Copy applications to related parts business action is applied within a Web UI, the selected application will be copied to the part(s) that have the selected application's part listed within the  reference type 'Part Relation.' In other words, the business action will create applications for any parts that have a relationship with the part used within the selected application.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For example, when using the References tab in workbench to view part VC21499 and VC36009, the   Part Relation Reference Type can be viewed as 'VC36112.'</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/BRs/Copy Application to Related/WBVC21499.png" />
        </p>
        <p>With the above configuration in place, the Application Manager can be used to select an application using part VC36112, and when the Bulk Updates action button is clicked, applications will be created for the parts VC21499 and VC36009 (as shown below).</p>
        <h3>Steps for Using the Business Action in Web UI</h3>
        <p>When the Parts Relation Reference Type is populated as shown above, the steps below can be used to copy an application to related parts using the Web UI.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If only one bulk update is configured, then the Bulk Applications Updates dialog will not display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Within the configured Application Manager, search for the applications to be copied. Select one or more applications with a part that uses the Part Relation reference type. For this example, part number VC36112 is used.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>Bulk Updates</b> action button. If more than one bulk update is configured then the Bulk Updates dialog will display (as shown above), otherwise this dialog is skipped and the copy applications to related parts bulk update background process will run (skip to step 5 below).</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Select the Copy Application To Related Parts  radio button from the list displayed within the Bulk Applications Updates dialog. For this example, 'Copy Application to Related Parts' is used, but the business action name displayed within the list is dependent upon the business action's Name parameter. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>OK</b> button and the copy applications to related parts business action will run for the selected applications.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Once the background process has completed, click the <b>Find applications</b> button to display the newly created application(s) within the Application Manager results table. For this example, notice that two new applications for the related parts have been created (as shown below).</li>
