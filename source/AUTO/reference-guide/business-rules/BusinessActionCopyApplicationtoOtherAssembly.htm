        <h1>Business Action: Copy Application to Other Assembly</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This automotive business action allows users to use a Bulk Updates action button within an Application Manager to copy one or more existing applications to another assembly / vehicle.  However, it will not copy an assembly / vehicle that is missing an application, and thus any missing applications selected when the bulk update is run will be ignored. For more information, see the <b>Missing Application Coverage Functionality</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Application Manager/Missing Application Coverage Functionality.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide. Setup is required within both STEP Workbench and Web UI for the action to be available to users.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Once configured, a Bulk Updates button within an Application Manager can be used to copy one or more existing applications to another assembly / vehicle. Below are the steps for using the business action in Web UI.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If only one bulk update is configured, then the Bulk Applications Updates dialog will not display.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Within the configured Application Manager, search for applications and select  one or more applications to be copied.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>Bulk Updates</b> action button. If more than one bulk update is configured, then the Bulk Updates dialog will display (as shown above), otherwise this dialog is skipped and the Copy Application To Other Assembly dialog will display (skip to step 5 below).</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Select the Copy Application To Other Assembly radio button from the list displayed within the Bulk Application Updates dialog. For this example, 'Copy Application To Other Assembly' is used, but the business action name displayed within the list is dependent upon the business action's Name parameter. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>OK</b> button and the Copy Application To Other Assembly dialog will display. For this example, 'Copy Application To Other Assembly' is used, but the title of this dialog is controlled by the business action's Name parameter.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Select the desired assembly for the application(s).</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>OK</b> button to close the dialog, and a background process notification will display. </li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Once the background process has completed, click the <b>Find applications</b> button to display the newly created application(s) within the Application Manager results table. </li>
        </ol>
