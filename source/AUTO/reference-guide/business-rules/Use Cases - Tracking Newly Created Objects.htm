        <h1>Use Cases - Tracking Newly Created Objects</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The user is responsible for configuring the PMDM for Automotive system to keep track of all newly  created objects on subsequent imports.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Consider an example that a new ACES file is imported into the system and all applications are stored in the system under their respective hierarchy. The next time the same file with an addition of few more applications is imported into the system, the newly created applications are tracked as defined below. </p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Track new objects created during import</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an attribute  (or verify that one exists) with the validity set to the object type(s) that need to be tracked. In this example, an attribute 'New Object' is created with the validity set to object type ACES Application.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Configure the business rule to include the newly created attribute  within the 'New object attribute' parameter in the 'Set import status attributes' operation. For more information on configuring the attribute in the business action, see the topic <b>Business Action: Set Import Status Attributes</b><MadCap:xref href="Business Action Set import status attributes.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. In the example below, the 'New Object' attribute is defined in the 'Set import status attributes' operation within the business action 'Set Change Flags.'</li>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Configure the <b>Import</b> state of the workflow with the updated business action discussed in the previous step.

        <p>When a file is imported, the system evaluates the contents of the import file as compared to the contents of the database, or against the previously loaded file of that type. For data that is observed to be a new object, the importer writes to the defined attribute  with  a value of  'true.' Hereafter, users shall determine their own strategy for managing the newly added objects.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, the ACES import created a new application for part VC21499. Because the application is new, the configured attribute New Object displays the value of 'true.'</p>
