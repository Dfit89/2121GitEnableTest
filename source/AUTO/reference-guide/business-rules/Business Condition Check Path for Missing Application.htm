        <h1>Business Condition: Check Path for Missing Application</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2713, 2733,2732 calculates validation path and check if one of the values is present in result. Easy Setup Creates the plugin, but it does not set it up.  For AutoCare the Validation Path Attribute is populated by Easy Setup but TD and NAPA are not.  See Word Doc in 2732 for setup</p>
        <p class="Body1">This business condition improves the accuracy of search results involving specific part types by allowing the data model to include a relationship between conditions on applications and different vehicle configurations. This can be helpful when specific part types do not apply to certain vehicle configurations. Additionally, it allows the Web UI Application Manager to search for applications with conditions for all sub models. </p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web">Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Easy Setup actions automatically create the Missing Application  Conditions attribute (MissingApplicationConditions) and the 'Check path for missing application' plugin; however, configuration is required prior to use. </p>
        <p class="Body1">When Easy Setup actions are used to create the  Missing Application  Conditions attribute (MissingApplicationConditions), the attribute is also made valid for NAPA MPCC, Part Terminology, and Standard Assembly GA object types. This validity must be applied manually if the attribute was created manually.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When Easy Setup actions are completed, the  'Check path for missing applications' plugin is created. However, the business condition must be made valid for the necessary object types.  </p>
        <h2>Improving Search Result Accuracy</h2>
        <p>When an  Application Manager is used to search for existing and missing applications for a specific part type, it is possible to get results that are not accurate based upon the relationship between the vehicle configuration and options for a part. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the application coverage is configured to consider the Condition and Part Type values, then searches like the 2013 Audi A3 example above will no longer include the DIESEL vehicle configuration results.</p>
        <p>Additional examples for part types that can have the Missing Application Conditions applied are for Coils or Ignition Module part types that are only valid for <b>Gas</b> Fuel Type but not valid for Diesel. Or for Part Types that are valid for <b>Gas</b> Fuel Type but not valid for Electric vehicles such as  Oxygen Sensors, Catalytic Converters, and Mufflers. While Glow Plug part type is valid only for <b>Diesel</b> Fuel Type but not for Gas or Electric.</p>
