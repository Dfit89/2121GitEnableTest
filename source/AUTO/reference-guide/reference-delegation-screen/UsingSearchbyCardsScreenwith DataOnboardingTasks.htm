        <h1>Using Search by Cards Screen with&#160;Data Onboarding Tasks</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When properly configured, a user clicking on an object in an Advanced Search Task List will be routed to a specific screen designated for display of objects in the particular workflow and state that the object is currently in. </p>
        <p class="Body1">What follows is an example that a user can utilize as a starting point to complete their own configuration. The directions and screenshots are designed under the assumption that the user has already set up all the screens required.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Bullet1">Log in to the Web UI and enter design mode.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Bullet1">Navigate through the properties to get to the Status Selector you will be editing (either Status Selector Sidebar Widget via the Main Properties or the Status Selector Homepage Widget). For more information, see the <b>Status Selector Sidebar Widget</b> in the <b>Web User Interface</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Workflows in Web UI/Getting Started/Status Selector Sidebar Widget.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. The <span class="bold">Results Screen</span> for the applicable Status Selector should be set up to go to the Advanced Search screen. If not, make the selection and click Save.</li>

            <li class="Bullet1">Select the Advanced Search Screen ID from the dropdown (it is Search advanced in the example below).

            <li class="Bullet1">On the Node List properties screen, disable / <span class="bold">uncheck</span> the Lookup Screen Type For Navigation parameter. Save these changes. </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">If Lookup Screen Type For Navigation is <span class="bold">unchecked</span>, then the object screen selection that is defined under Selection Screens will be used as a target screen (e.g., Asset Selection Screen, Classification Selection Screen, Product Selection Screen, and Entity Selection Screen).</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">If Lookup  Screen Type For Navigation is checked, then the screen mappings that are defined in the Main Properties screen are used when selecting the object from the Node List.</li>

                <p>Select a Forwarding Switch Screen from the Product Selection Screen dropdown. Save the Node List Properties. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="Bullet1">From the screen dropdown selector (to the left of the Save button), pull up the properties for the screen designated as the Product Selection Screen. In this example, it is the Screen_TaskList2_Forwarding screen. </li>
            <li class="Bullet1">In the Forwarding Switch Screen Properties, define the workflow condition that should show on the screen when selecting an object link within a Node List. </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Click Add to add a mapping. This will open Screen Mapping Properties.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">On Screen Mapping Properties, under the Conditions field, click Add. </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Select 'Workflow Condition' from the component list and click Add. </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Make a State and Workflow selection. Click Add again. Users should continue mapping any additional workflow states, if applicable, that will be going to the <span class="italic">same </span>screen. When done, click the dropdown for the Screen parameter and make a selection. Click Add.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Save the Forwarding Switch Screen Properties.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Repeat the steps in the previous bullets as needed.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Save any additional changes and close Web UI Designer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;"><span class="bold">If mapping is set up for one state in a workflow displayed using a Status Selector, mappings should be set up for all displayed states of the workflow to avoid end users seeing a 'No mapping found' message when clicking on an object ID in the results set.</span>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The result is that when a user clicks on the a workflow state on the Status Selector, the results are shown in an Advanced Search Task List. When a user clicks on the ID for an object in the results set, the screen is redirected to the forwarding screen that is specified by the workflow condition. </p>
        <p class="Body1" style="margin-top: 2mm;">In the example shown in the screenshots, when a user clicks on the Review Data state on the Status Selector, the result is shown in the Advanced Search Task List. When the user clicks on of the ID links, the screen in this example is redirected to an Items Details screen. See the screenshots that follow.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">If an object is in more than one workflow, or in multiple states in the same workflow, a 'Select workflow state' dialog appears for the user to specify the state they would like to see the object in. Users need to make a selection or selections using the dropdowns that are active / available. The top dropdown is for workflow selection, and the bottom dropdown is for state selection. </p>

        <p class="Body1">Once selections are made, the user clicks OK and is then redirected to the designated screen for the selected workflow state.</p>
