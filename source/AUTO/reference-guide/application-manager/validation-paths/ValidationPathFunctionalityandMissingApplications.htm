        <h1>Validation Path Functionality and Missing Applications</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The automotive validation path functionality aids in displaying missing application coverage by evaluating all options and/or criteria for existing applications and displaying only those options that are valid for the vehicle configuration. In other words, consider when a vehicle is available with two different engines, and a part is applied to engine A,  vehicles with engine B will display as a missing application. </p>
        <p class="Body1">When automotive validation path functionality is in place, and a part is applicated for a vehicle, a missing application will display for each condition related to the part in the search as a single row within both the Application Manager results table, and the Application Coverage Report.</p>
        <p class="Body1">More information on missing application coverage can be found within the <b>Missing Application Coverage Functionality</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Missing Application Coverage Functionality.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> of this guide.</p>
