        <h1>Using Options Search Boxes</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Attributes or references within STEP can be displayed as options within an Application Manager. The attribute and/or reference values can then be selected as search criteria. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The Options search boxes allow users to choose pre-configured attribute and/or reference type options, and the valid criteria, to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Options search boxes. For more information on the general functionality found within the search boxes, see the <b>Using Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Boxes.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Options search boxes can be configured to allow users to select up to two attribute and/or reference type options. The attribute and/or reference type option dropdown is located in the top left corner of the Options search box. Clicking the down arrow to the right of the Options search box label, or clicking the label itself will display the available options within the dropdown. Using the Options search box dropdown, users can choose criteria related to different search options (i.e., Sub Model, Region, Engine, Fuel Type). In the example below, two Options search boxes have been configured. The Options search box on  the left displays the option 'Sub Model' by default, and the one on the right displays the option 'Region' by default. Clicking the option label displays a dropdown of available options for each Options search box (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">A Search Panel can have up to two Options search boxes. When two Options search box types are configured, an AND / OR toggle button displays between the two boxes. This toggle button allows users to determine if the search criteria within the two Options search box types should be inclusive or exclusive of each other. The AND / OR toggle button only applies to the criteria within the two Options search box types. It does not affect the inclusion of the criteria within the other search box types (i.e., Make/Model, Year, Part Type). </p>
        <p class="Body1">When the toggle button displays 'AND,' then the search results only display a match for the criteria provided within Options search box 1 <b style="font-style: italic;">and</b> Options search box 2. However, when the toggle button displays 'OR,' then the search results will display a match for the criteria provided within Options search box 1 <b style="font-style: italic;">or</b> Options search box 2.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2725 </MadCap:conditionalText>The Options search box typeahead field results are dependent upon selections made in the Make/Model and Year search boxes. In the example below, the Toyota 4Runner is added to the Make/Model search box, and the 2015 year is added to the Year search box, allowing the Sub Model search box dropdown to only display options related to the 2015 4Runner. When the Sub Model option criteria is selected, then the dropdown displays only those sub models available for the 2015 4Runner.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Adding additional makes or models to the Make/Model search box will expand the Options search box dropdown results. In the example below, the Toyota and Jeep makes have been added, and result in all Toyota, Jeep, and 4Runner sub models displaying within the Sub Model Options search box dropdown. (Though the long list of available sub models cannot be seen in the screenshot, the display of a mixture of available sub models is apparent with the inclusion of the Jeep Rubicon, Toyota Hybrid SE, and Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro.)</p>

        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p class="Body1">By changing the Option selection from Sub Model to Engine, the results  dropdown only displays the one engine available for the 2015 4Runner.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Additionally, when two Options search boxes are enabled, allowing for the 'AND / OR' toggle button to be set to 'AND,' the dropdown for the options cards will also be dependent upon selections made between the two Options search boxes. In the example below, the Region criterion has been set to Canada, so the Sub Model search box displays only those sub model options available for the 2015 4Runner in Canada. Notice from the previous example, the TRD Pro was available for selection, until the Canada region criterion was added, because the 2015 TRD Pro sub model is not available in Canada. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Options search boxes will not automatically display the suggested dropdown options until at least one value is added to the Make/Model search box.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Optionally, the Report button can be used to export these results to an Excel file.
