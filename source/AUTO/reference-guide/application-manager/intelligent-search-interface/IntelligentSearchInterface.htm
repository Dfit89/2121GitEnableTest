        <p class="Body1">The intelligent search interface of an Application Manager screen is composed of the following:</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/AM.png" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Vehicle type icon:</b>
                <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDCUST-2647 </MadCap:conditionalText> A visual representation of the 'Vehicle Type Search Panel' contents. Clicking a vehicle type icon displays the configured Vehicle Type Search Panel for the vehicle type (i.e., Personal Cars, Buses, Marine, Street Bikes). Hovering over the icon will display the name configured for the Vehicle Type Search Panel.  Each Application Manager must have at least one vehicle type icon. Up to <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">five </MadCap:conditionalText>six icons can be displayed within the same Application Manager.   For a list of available icons, and more information about the Vehicle type icon, see the <b>Configuring Application Manager</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Configuring Application Manager/Configuring Application Manager.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide. </li>
            <li><b>Vehicle Type Search Panel:</b> Has many configuration parameters, and can consist of up to four 'search box types' (Make/Model, Year, Options Group, and Part Type). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2673 </MadCap:conditionalText>Because many of the search boxes are synchronized, search criteria can be entered into any one of the search boxes in any order, and the available search criteria will display in the typeahead dropdown based upon the criteria entered within the other search boxes. For more information on using the Search Boxes within the Vehicle Type Search Panel, see the <b>Using Intelligent Search Interface</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Intelligent Search Interface.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Though only four search box types exist, the above screenshot displays five. This is possible because the search boxes labeled Sub Model and Region are both part of the Options Group search box type. For more information on the Options search boxes, see the <b>Using the Options Search Boxes</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Options Search Boxes.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Saved search tool:</b> Allows users to save previously selected search criteria with custom names, and then quickly populate previously saved search criteria by selecting the name of a saved search from the saved search dropdown. The tool consists of a saved search dropdown field, as well as Save, Rename, and Delete icons. For more information about the saved search tool, see the <b>Saved Search Tool</b> section<MadCap:xref href="Saved Search Tool.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> of this guide.</li>
            <li><b>Existing and missing applications dropdown:</b> Allows users to determine if their search should or should not contain missing applications. To search or report on missing applications, users can select either the  'Missing Applications Only' or 'Existing and Missing Applications' options from the Existing and Missing Applications dropdown. Additionally, users can select the 'Existing Applications Only' option, if the desired results should only display existing applications. For more information about missing applications, see the <b>Missing Application Coverage Functionality</b> topic<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><MadCap:xref href="../Missing Application Coverage Functionality.htm" class="HereWithParens"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText> within this guide.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Hierarchy Restriction dropdown:</b> Allows  users to restrict the Application Manager search results by object type. Users can select from a pre-configured dropdown list of  object types. This can be helpful when search results needs to be filtered by Brand, Manufacturer, OEM, Product Line, etc. When the parameter is blank, the Hierarchy Restriction dropdown will not display within the Application Manager. In other words, this option can be removed from an Application Manager screen by removing all object types from the Hierarchy Restriction Object Types parameter. For more information, see the <b>Configuring Application Manager</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Configuring Application Manager/Configuring Application Manager.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Both the 'Existing and missing applications' and 'Hierarchy Restriction' dropdowns are tied to the Vehicle type icon. Each time a Vehicle Type icon is selected, the two dropdowns will reset to their defaults ('Existing Applications Only' and 'All Brands').</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Application Coverage Report button:</b> Allows users to export an Application Coverage Report  in an Excel spreadsheet (XLSX file type). This report provides results based upon the combination of the search criteria, Existing and Missing Applications dropdown, and Brand dropdown selections. Because this report is built to work with the intelligent search interface of the Application Manager, it is extremely configurable. This allows users the flexibility to choose the report criteria that best suits their needs on demand, and then easily export the search results. The Report button remains disabled until at least one search box is populated. For more information, see the <b>Application Coverage Report</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="../Application Coverage Report.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</li>
            <li><b>Clear All link: </b>
                <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2670, 2797 </MadCap:conditionalText> Allows users to easily clear all search criteria, results, and filters applied to Results Table. The Clear All link remains disabled until at least one criterion for one of the search boxes is populated. When text is typed into a search box, but is not yet selected, clicking the link will also remove the text typed into the search box. Additionally, criterion can be cleared one at a time by clicking the '<span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;">X</span>' to the right of a value within a search box. Clearing criteria in either way does not update the search results. Once any unnecessary criteria are removed, the Report or Search buttons must be used to update the results table.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When the results table is populated, and one or more criteria are changed, clicking the Search button will initiate a new search and the results table will only display results related to that search.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Search button: </b>
                <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2795 </MadCap:conditionalText> When clicked, the Search button will use the criteria provided within the search boxes, selections made within the Existing and Missing Applications dropdown, and/or Brand dropdown, and then provide any results in the results table. The Search button remains disabled until at least search boxes is populated. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU RDUCST-2661 </MadCap:conditionalText>Requiring only one criterion within the Make/Model, Part Type, or Options search boxes, allows users to conduct very broad searches. For example, to view existing applications for Spark Plugs,  type 'Spark Plugs' into the Part Type search box. With 'Existing Applications Only' selected, click the Search button to display all the existing applications for Spark Plugs in the results table. However, to view missing applications, this type of broad search would be very time consuming, therefore it is recommended to use additional search criteria, or use the Application Coverage Report button, instead of the Search button. When the Search button is clicked, and no results are available, a 'No Result' dialog will display, as shown below. Clicking the <b>OK</b> button closes the dialog, and allows the remaining search criteria to be adjusted.</li>
