        <p class="Body1">Once a vehicle is listed within the results table, a user can create an application by clicking into the Part Number cell, and providing a part number for the vehicle. In the example below the Part Number cell was blank, upon double clicking within the cell, the gray borders of the cell change to blue, indicating it is active and ready to be edited, and a node selector icon displays.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the Part Number cell is active, users can type in the necessary part number. As the Part Number is typed in, the typeahead dropdown will display a list of potential part number matches. Users can use the down arrow key to navigate from the field down into the list, and then use the Enter key to populate the field with the part number. Optionally, the mouse pointer can be used to click on the valid part number. </p>

        <p>When the Search tab within the Part Number Search dialog is used, a portion of a part number can be typed in, and the Search button can be clicked to display a list of part IDs and Names. In the example below, '034' is typed into the search field, and four potential matches are displayed.</p>
