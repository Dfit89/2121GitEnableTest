        <h1>Using Name Search Card</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Name search card allows users to add a name criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Name search card. For more information on the general functionality found within the search cards, see the <b>Using Search Cards</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Cards.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> located in this documentation.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Within the Name search card, the typeahead field can be used to search for the name of the object that is intended for search, and the use of an asterisk will allow for a wildcard search. Only Names are searched, not IDs. The dropdown list displays criteria options alphabetically. For example, if '*Acu' is typed into the field, then the dropdown list displays the object name (of the object type that is defined in the design mode) containing 'Acu' alphabetically (as shown below).</p>
