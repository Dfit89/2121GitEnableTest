        <h1>Using Search by Cards Screen with&#160;Data Onboarding Tasks</h1>
        <p>While the Search by Card Screen is designed to perform a search based on the valid combinations of Name, parent hierarchy, and attribute values, one use case for this Search by Card Screen in Onboarding task is to display the searched result object on Onboarding Comparison Screen by using Forward Screen Action button.</p>
        <p>This topic describes how to navigate an object displayed in the search result table  onto Onboarding Comparison Screen that is used in the Onboarding tasks.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">An understanding of how to configure the Forward Screen Action button as a toolbar component in the Search by Cards Screen.

        </ul>
        <h2>Navigating to the Onboarding Comparison Screen</h2>
        <p>When accessing the Onboarding Comparison Screen via a Forward Screen Action button, the default screen behavior varies depending on whether or not the Target object exists. Also, the presence of  multiple Target objects for the selected Source object does not allow to display the Onboarding Comparison Screen. If there exists no Target object, or if there exists multiple Target objects for the selected Source object, then the following error message will be displayed on the screen.</p>
