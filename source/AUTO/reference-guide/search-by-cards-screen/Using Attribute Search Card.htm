        <h1>Using Attribute Search Card</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Attribute search card allows users to add one or more attribute criteria to their search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Attribute search card. For more information on the general functionality found within the search cards, see the <b>Using Search Cards</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Cards.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When the cursor is placed within the typeahead field for the Attribute search card, and all other search cards are blank, the dropdown will not display until at least the initial characters are typed into the typeahead field. The minimum character(s) requirement for typeahead is configured in design mode. For more on configuration, see the <b>Configuring the Attribute Search Box</b> topic within this guide<MadCap:xref href="Configuring Attribute Search Box.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p class="Body1">When multiple attributes are defined to be in the search criteria within the same Attribute search card,  a dropdown will be displayed next to the title of the search card that allows users to select the required attribute search criteria (as shown below).</p>
