        <h1>Using Hierarchy Search Card</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Hierarchy search card allows users to add parent hierarchy criteria to their search. The Hierarchy search card lets users search based on their parent objects in order to narrow down the search. This section addresses functionality that is specific to the Hierarchy search card. For more information on the general functionality found within the search cards, see the <b>Using Search Cards</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Search Cards.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p class="Body1"> Within the Hierarchy search card, the typeahead field can be used to search for parent criteria. The dropdown list will display the criteria options alphabetically by parent, and then by child.  For example, if 'A4' is typed into the field, then the dropdown list displays the Audi, Austin, Checker, and Mercedes-Benz parents alphabetically, and the children that match the information typed into the field (A4) will be listed alphabetically below their respective parents (as shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the text typed in matches a parent only, then all children below that parent will be displayed. For example, if 'maz' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Mazda parent with all its available children listed below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the text typed in  matches a child only,  then the parent for the matching child is displayed with only the child that matches the search string. For example, if 'fox' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Audi and Volkswagen parents with the 'Fox' children listed below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the text typed in matches the parent and child, then the matching parents and/or children will display within the dropdown for selection. For example, if 'opel' is  typed into the field, then the dropdown list will display the Buick parent with the Opel child beneath, and then the Opel parent will display with all of its available children below. </p>

        <p>To search for a parent with a specific child, using the keyboard space bar, groupings of two or more characters can be typed into the field to narrow down the search.   The keyboard space bar  allows for the following text to conduct a 'contains' search for parents with specific children. For example, to display all the Audi models containing Quattro, the following can be entered into the parent / child field: 'aud [space bar] qua.'</p>
