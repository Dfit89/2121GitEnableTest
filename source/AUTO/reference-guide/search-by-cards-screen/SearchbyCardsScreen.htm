        <h1>Search by Card Screen</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Search by Card Screen uses the sync between search cards functionality to provide an easy-to-use intelligent search interface. This makes it possible for the user to narrow down the search result and only see the relevant result. This screen can be configured to define the most likely used filter groups for the search in the Web UI. For example, if the user needs to find a vehicle based on the Name, Make, Model, Year, or any attribute value, and the  search cards are configured to be available for each of these search criteria in the Search by Card Screen, then users can refine the list of objects based on one or more of the available filters.</p>
        <p>The top half of the Search by Card Screen offers features related to the intelligent search interface. The bottom half of the screen is dedicated to the search results table and its toolbar</p>

        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Search by Card Screen is highly configurable via the Web UI Designer, and more than one Search by Card Screen can be created within each Web UI. Therefore, it is expected that a Web UI administrator will configure a Search by Card Screen in a manner that best meets their user's needs.

        <h2>Search by Card Screen Interface Overview</h2>
        <p>The top half of the Search by Card Screen offers features related to the intelligent search interface. The bottom half of the screen is dedicated to the search results table and its toolbar. The Search by Card Screen is composed of the following:</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Search by Card Screen/11.png" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Title:</b> Users can edit the Title in Design mode with any text string.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Card based search panel:</b> Use cards to narrow down the search result and only see relevant nodes. Users can configure the cards to use attributes, parent hierarchy, or Name. All of the configured cards  are synchronized, and the search criteria can be entered into the cards in any order, and the available search criteria will display in the typeahead dropdown based upon the criteria that have been entered within the other cards.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Saved search tool:</b> Allows users to save previously selected search criteria with custom names, and then quickly populate previously saved search criteria by selecting the name of a saved search from the saved search dropdown. The tool consists of a saved search dropdown field, as well as Save, Rename, and Delete icons. For more information about the saved search tool, see the <b>Saved Search Tool</b> topic within the <b>Application Manager</b> section   of this guide<MadCap:xref href="../Application Manager/Intelligent Search Interface/Saved Search Tool.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Clear All link:</b> Allows users to clear all search criteria and results that are displayed in the results table. The Clear All link remains disabled until at least one criterion for one of the search cards is populated. When text is typed into a search card, but is not yet selected, clicking the link will also remove the text typed into the search card. Additionally, a criterion can be cleared one at a time by clicking the '<span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;">X</span>' to the right of a value within a search card. Clearing the criteria in either way does not update the search results. Once any unnecessary criteria are removed, the Search button must be used to update the results table.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Search button: </b>When clicked, the Search button will use the criteria that are provided within the search cards, and then provide results matching the search criteria in the results table. The Search button remains disabled until at least one search card is populated.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Results table toolbar:</b> Allows users to configure action buttons, such as bulk update or export, relative to the Search by Card results table. Action buttons can be configured using the Web UI Designer. For more information about action buttons, see the <b>Action Buttons</b> section of the <b>Web User Interfaces</b> guide within <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Action Buttons.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Display Mode:</b> Allows user to change the display modes. The list of available display modes can be edited as needed by accessing the Search by Cards Node List Properties Child Component Display Modes parameter. For more information on the list of available display modes, see the <b>Node List Component</b> topic within the <b>Web User Interfaces</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Node List Component.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Flip table icon:</b> <img src="../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/Flip table icon.png" /> Allows users to change or flip the orientation of the table.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Row selection boxes:</b> Allows for selection of one or more rows within the table. Selecting at least one row can change the action buttons that display within the  toolbar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Bullet3NextPara">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AppMgr/ResultsTable/Row selection boxes.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Hyperlinks:</b> When text within the results table displays as a hyperlink, users are able to click the text and a screen specific to that text will display.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Search by Card Screen/9.png" />

        <ol start="11">
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Results table:</b> Displays the list of search results. A Node List component is used to display the results of selections made within the intelligent search interface. Each column label can be edited as needed by accessing the Search by Cards Node List Properties Headers parameter.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1"><b>Edited items panel:</b> Contains an expand / collapse arrow, Save, and Reset buttons. When the panel is expanded and changes are made to the results table, the changes are displayed as a list in the panel. In the example below, it is easy to see that the 034-VC36004(2) object has been edited. By default, the 'Use Immediate Save' parameter within the Node List Properties is disabled. When enabled, the Save button will not display, and the list of edited items will briefly display.</li>
