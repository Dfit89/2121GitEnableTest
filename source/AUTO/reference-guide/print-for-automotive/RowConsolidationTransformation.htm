        <h1>Row Consolidation Transformation</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note:  RDPRT-3866. This was previously a custom transformation (do we need to mention this, since it's new to everyone else?) I believe that it is also an expansion of what was known as the Year Consolidation transformation? </p>
        <p class="Body1">The automotive Row Consolidation transformation has been upgraded to allow for adjacent rows to be consolidated (merged together) based on the data in <i>more than one</i> column being different. Previously, the Row Consolidation transformation would only allow for two adjacent rows to be consolidated if the data in <i>one</i> specified column was different. The updated Row Consolidation transformation allows for multiple selections of column types and also handles the special situation with the consolidation of date ranges.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Different date values, such as those for year, are a typical reason that rows need to be consolidated. When additional information is added, such as months, then a date range consolidation is also required. This date range consolidation has been achieved in the enhanced Row Consolidation transformation.</p>
        <p class="Body1">

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The following example shows a table as it appears before the transformation is applied. The first 5 rows (light blue background) can be consolidated to one row, and the next two rows (light yellow) can also be consolidated to one row. The columns that are allowed to have different values are: Model, Type, Eng Code, and the four columns that denote the start / end year and month.</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoRowConsol_Before.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">After applying the transformation—which will consolidate multiple rows by comparing two adjacent rows—the result should resemble the following. The differing values in the Model, Type, and Eng Code columns remain; identical values in the Make, #Cyl, Eng Size, Fuel, and KW columns have been merged; and the differing values in the start / end year and month columns have been merged into date ranges. </p>

        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Consolidating rows based on consecutive numbers in a column</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Consider the following table:</p>
        <p class="Image1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoAppTableExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Assume that the table above will already be sorted (using the standard Sorting transformation) so that similar records are adjacent to each other. Note that the Year column is sorted in descending order. The first three rows highlighted in the screenshot are indicative of the other row groupings in the table: </p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoAppTableExample_Sorted.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">A “compaction” of Application Records may be done by consolidating on a specific column type, e.g., the Year column. The list of column types in the Column Type dropdown displays the valid column types for the table. The Transformation setup looks like this:</p>
        <p class="Image1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoPrint_RowConsol2.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">For consolidating records based on a Year (or any number), then the option “Consecutive Numbers” should be chosen. The “Drop Characters at position” option allows for an entry of 2015-2010 to be curtailed to 2015-10. The “separator” is usually a hyphen but could be any text string. Based on how the rows were sorted before the transformation, it will automatically determine whether the year range should be low-high or high-low (e.g., 2015-10 or 2010-15).</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">The result of consolidating rows based on the 'Year' column in this example would be:</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoAppTable_RowsConsolidated.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Subsequent transformations will organize the table into its final display.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If any two adjacent rows have identical data (including the Year value), then the system should consolidate the duplicated row, so the transformation will avoid the condition of two consecutive identical rows.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Error Handling </h3>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">If the selected Column Type occurs more than once in the Table definition, a warning will be posted and entered in the log. Thus, if there is more than one column with the Column Type of Spec Type 1: </p>
        <p class="Image1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoPrint_RowConsolError.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If an additional column is inserted in the Table Definition after the Row Consolidation transformation has been set up, and the column type is the one that is already established in the transformation, the system will again take only first column type encountered in the table and log the warning.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Consolidating rows based on different values in a column</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">For consolidating rows that do not have consecutive numbers, the “Other” option should be selected. For example: </p>
        <p class="Image1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoPrint_RowConsol4.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Here we wish to consolidate these rows based on the Column Type = Comment. Assume that prior transformations (e.g., sorting) have been applied before the Row Consolidation transformation is applied. In this case we would have the options set similar to this:</p>
        <p class="Image1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Table ComponentImages/AutoPrint_RowConsol5.png" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">Note that the “Drop characters at position” option is only enabled when the “Consecutive Numbers” option is selected. And the result would be like this. Note that consecutive rows with identical values will be merged and the transformation will avoid the condition of two consecutive identical rows.</p>
