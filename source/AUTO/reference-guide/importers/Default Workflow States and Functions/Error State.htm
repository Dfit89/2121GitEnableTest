        <h1>Error State</h1>
        <p>Files that have failed validation, conversion, or delta calculation will have the controller end up in the Error state, and it will remain there until acted on by a user. It is not possible to do further processing of the file after it has errored, though it can be subsequently reloaded if needed. As described in the <b>Automotive Quick Start Guide</b>, users are able to view the errors generated in validation, conversion, or delta calculation by clicking the appropriate background process links to view the corresponding execution reports. They can also choose to discard the file, which will  transition the file to the Discard File state, which contains a business rule that automatically removes the controller from the workflow so that it is no longer displayed in the workflow tasks in the Web UI. </p>
