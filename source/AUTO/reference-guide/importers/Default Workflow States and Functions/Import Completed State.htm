        <h1>Import Completed State</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When import has completed, the controller object is automatically passed to the Import Completed state where it will remain until a user takes action on it. The only option for action is to discard the file, which passes the controller object to the Discard File state, effectively removing it from the workflow.</p>
