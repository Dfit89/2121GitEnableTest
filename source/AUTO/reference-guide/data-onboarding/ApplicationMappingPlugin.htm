        <h1>Application Mapping Plugin</h1>
        <p>The Application Mapping plugin will move applications from the Source object to the Target object, as well as establish references for the Target applications to Target vehicles and Target part types. The Application Mapping plugin is added and configured in the Onboarding Mappings Details Screen for the selected Mapper Configuration.</p>
