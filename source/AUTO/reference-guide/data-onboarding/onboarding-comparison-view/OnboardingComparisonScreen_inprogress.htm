        <h1>Onboarding Comparison Screen</h1>
        <p>Often in the process of Data Onboarding, a large quantity of data is being imported and onboarded in the system. Sometimes it is required by the user to preview the changes affecting the Target object even before the data is onboarded. The Onboarding Comparison Screen allows users to preview the onboarding data, assess each of the changes, and provides users an option to accept or reject the changes that will affect the Target object.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Onboarding Comparison Screen allows users to configure a Mapper Configuration  setup entity and compares the selected Source object with the Target object in the context of the configured Mapper Configuration  setup entity. With the Source object selected, users can view the changes affecting the Target object. Also, an option is provided to partially / fully accept or reject the affecting changes.   If the user chooses to accept full / partial changes, the Mapper Configuration  setup entity will be executed on the Source object and only the selected changes will be effected on the Target object.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Generally, the Onboarding Comparison Screen is used if the user discretion is required towards the acceptance / rejection of the onboarding changes. If all of the data needs to be onboarded without the user discretion then the user can choose to use any of the methods described in the <b>Executing Mapper Configuration Setup Entity</b> <MadCap:xref href="../Executing Mapper configuration setup entity.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> topic to directly onboard the data.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Onboarding Comparison Screen requires an object selection, and can be configured to be accessed through many different ways, below are the common ways of accessing it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuring in the Search by Card Screen or any other search screen using Forward Screen Action button. For more information, see <b>Using Search by Cards Screen with&#160;Data Onboarding Tasks</b> topic within this guide<MadCap:xref href="../../Search By Cards Screen/Using Search by Cards Screen with&#160;Data Onboarding Tasks.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Mapping an Onboarding Comparison Screen to be displayed when the Source object is selected in the Web UI. For information on mapping the screen for a particular object type, see the <b>Mappings</b> topic within the <b>Main Properties Overview</b> section of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Main Properties/Mappings.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Added as a tab page within another screen that is configured to display when the Source object is selected. To add to an existing screen, use the Sub Screen Tab Page configuration, described in the <b>Tab Pages</b> topic in the <b>Web User Interfaces</b> / <b>Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation of <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Node Details/Tab Pages.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p class="Body1">It is expected that anyone configuring the Onboarding Comparison Screen is familiar with the Web UI Designer, as basic concepts for working with the designer are not covered in this section. In addition, the user must have appropriate privileges to access the designer. Additional information can be found in the <span class="bold">Designer Access</span> section of the <span class="bold">Web User Interfaces</span> / <span class="bold">Web UI Getting Started</span> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Web UI Getting Started/Designer Access.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
