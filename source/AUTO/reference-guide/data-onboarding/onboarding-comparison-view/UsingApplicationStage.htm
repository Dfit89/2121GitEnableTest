        <h1>Using Applications Stage</h1>
        <p>When the application records are moved from the Source object to the Target object, there are enormous amount of data belonging to the application record is moved. Instead of users manually switching between the Source  and the Target objects for comparing the application records, the Applications stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen displays the application records related to the Source object against the Target object on the same screen. The screen is designed to showcase the similarities / differences between the Source object applications and the Target object applications based on the rule defined on the Mapper rows of the Application Mapping plugin for the configured Mapper Configuration setup entity.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Applications stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen displays all the active Application Mapping plugin along with their active Mapper rows that are available within the configured Mapper Configuration  setup entity. This stage displays only the Source and the Target object's application records that are defined in each active Mapper rows of the Application Mapping plugin(s).  </p>
        <p class="Body1">Each Attribute Mapping plugin will have a dedicated canvas called 'Attribute Mapping plugin canvas'. The options available within each canvas allows users to individually decide what rule of the Mapper Configuration setup entity should be executed for the selected Source object that in turn effects the related Target object attributes.</p>
        <p class="Body1">This section addresses features and functionalities that are only specific to the Attributes stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen. For information on the general functionalities of the Onboarding Comparison Screen, see the <b>Using Onboarding Comparison Screen Interface</b> topic<MadCap:xref href="Using Onboarding Comparison Screen Interface.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> within this guide.</p>
        <p>The Attributes stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen  is composed of the following:</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/209.png" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Source object name:</b> Displays the name of the Source object.</li>
            <li><b>Progress Tracker:</b> The titles of all the stages that make up the Onboarding display beneath the number of the stage which displays in a circle. The number of the stage will be highlighted blue when selected. Users may navigate between the stages by clicking on either the stage number or stage labels that display. The highlighted stage shows the current stage of the Onboarding process in the Onboarding Comparison Screen. In the screenshot above, the Onboarding Comparison Screen displays the Attributes stage. </li>
            <li><b>Comparison table toolbar:</b><![CDATA[  ]]></li>

        </p>
        <p class="Body2">Contains action buttons related to the Attributes stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen. Available action buttons are hard coded to always display in the toolbar and cannot be configured in any way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>Select all / Clear all:</b> The 'Clear all' button displays when one or more rows are selected using the 'Mapping plugin / Mapper row selection boxes.' When no rows are selected, the 'Select all' button will display. Clicking the 'Clear all' button will remove the selections within the 'Mapping plugin / Mapper row selection boxes.' Clicking this button will not clear the values in the comparison table, but rather disables the selection of 'Mapping plugin / Mapper row selection boxes.' Clicking the 'Select all' button enables all the 'Mapping plugin / Mapper row selection boxes'.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>Hide Equal / Show Equal:</b> This action helps in finding out the row that has the Source object attribute and Target object attribute of equal values. The Comparison table is defaulted to always display these rows.  It is to be observed that the rows that has the Source object attribute and Target object attribute of equal values does not include a row selection box (as shown below). However, clicking on the 'Hide Equal' button will hide such rows that has same values in the Source object attribute and Target object attribute. When the table displays with these rows compressed, the 'Show Equal' button will display within the toolbar instead of the 'Hide Equal' button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Image3">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/212.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>View Source Attribute / Hide Source Attribute:</b> By default, the Comparison table does not display the Source attribute name. Clicking the ‘View Source Attribute’ button will make the Source attribute name to be displayed in gray color below their respective Target attribute name  (as shown below). Meanwhile, the ‘Hide Source Attribute’ button will compress the Source attribute name displayed below their respective Target attribute name. However, the Source attribute value will always remain to be displayed in the '[Supplier] values' column irrespective of the display / suppression of the Source attribute name. When the table displays the Source attribute name, the 'Hide Source Attribute' button will display within the toolbar instead of the 'View Source Attribute' button. </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>View Attribute ID / Hide Attribute ID: </b> By default, the Comparison table does not display the Source / Target attribute ID. Clicking the ‘View Attribute ID’ button will make the attribute ID surrounded by parentheses to be displayed next to the Source / Target attribute name. The following screenshot shows an example of the attribute ID displayed for both the Source object and the Target object.</li>

            <li><b>Attribute Mapping plugin canvas: </b>Each active Attribute Mapping plugin(s) that are available in the Mapper Configuration setup entity will have a dedicated section in the Attributes stage, and each individual section is called as Attribute Mapping plugin canvas. Each Attribute Mapping plugin canvas is  identified by their respective plugin name. Each canvas includes active Mapper rows belonging to that Attribute Mapping plugin. In the example below, a canvas is identified by the Attribute Mapping plugin name called 'Copy Attribute Values.' </li>

        <p class="Body2">In the example above, the current value of the Target attribute 'Own Text'  will be replaced by the value 'AC2493,' therefore it is highlighted with red color in the table. And the value of the Target attribute 'Number Multi Valued' will not be changed, therefore it is not highlighted in the table.</p>
        <p class="Body2">Each Attribute Mapping plugin canvas consists of the following:</p>

        <ol start="2" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Mapping Plugin row selection box: </b>Allows for selection of each Attribute Mapping plugin that are displayed in the Attributes stage of the Onboarding Comparison Screen. Selecting the checkbox also selects all the Mapper rows displayed within the respective Attribute Mapping plugin canvas.</li>
            <li><b>Auto Update switch:</b> Activating this will ensure that all the Mapper rows listed in this canvas will automatically be included for execution in all future Onboarding for the selected Source object. The settings applied in this switch will be defaulted for all methods of future execution and is applicable only for the selected Source object. It is set to inactive as default.  When the switch is turned On, the Mapping plugin row selection box (along with their included Mapper rows selection box(es)) is selected and are grayed out. That means no individual deselection of the Mapper rows are allowed and the whole of the mapper rows listed within the canvas are executed on the particular Source object. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body2">After turning On / Off the Auto Update switch in any Mapping canvas, the user should click the <b>Onboard</b> button (that is available in the in the lower right corner of the Confirm stage) to save changes made to the Auto Update switch in the Onboarding Comparison Screen. As stated previously, users may safely navigate between the stages in Onboarding Comparison Screen without losing unsaved selections, but users should not exit Onboarding without first navigating to the final screen and clicking the Onboard button.</p>
        <p class="important2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">Remember, the Auto Update switch is set to inactive as default. If no Auto Update switch is activated in any of the Mapping canvas (across all Mapping stages), then the execution of the Mapper Configuration setup entity continues to function as before and no Mapping canvas will be excluded from execution. If any Auto Update switch from any of the Mapping canvas is set active (turned On), then the other Mapping  canvas will  be excluded from execution. Care must be taken to check the Auto Update status of all Mapping canvas across all stages while activating / deactivating the Auto Update switch. </p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction,Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC Note: if the Auto Update switch belonging to other Mapping canvas remains deactivated after activating Auto Update switch in any of the Mapping canvas, then the future execution of the Mapper Configuration setup entity <i>will not</i> execute any Mapping canvas that has the Auto Update switch deactivated.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC Note: Activating this will ensure that all the Mapper rows listed in this canvas will automatically be included for execution in all future Onboarding for the selected Source object. The settings applied in this It is set to inactive as default. Turning On this switch within the 'Mapping plugin canvas' will ensure that all the Mapper rows listed in this canvas will always be executed by default for all future Onboarding via Onboarding Comparison Screen. When the switch is turned On, the Mapping plugin row selection box (along with their included Mapper rows selection box(es)) is selected and are grayed out. That means no individual selection of the Mapper rows are allowed and the whole of the mapper rows listed within the canvas is executed.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC Note: If users have selected the Auto Update switch in any Mapping canvas to any stage in Onboarding Comparison Screen, on the Confirm stage the Onboard button in the lower right-hand corner will be present. Clicking this button is the only way to ensure that Auto Update switch in the Onboarding Comparison Screen stage is saved. As stated previously, users may safely navigate between the stages in Onboarding Comparison Screen without losing unsaved selections, but users should not exit Onboarding without first navigating to the final screen and clicking the Onboard button.</p>
        <ol start="2" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Expand / collapse arrow: </b> When the arrow is clicked, the Mapping plugin canvas where the Mapper rows are listed is collapsed (not showing). However, the name of the Mapping plugin and the Auto Update switch will still be visible in the canvas (as shown below). Clicking the arrow again will expand display of the collapsed Mapper rows. This can be beneficial to users who use Auto Update switch within the Mapping plugin canvas. If the user already knows the Mapper rows that exists within the Mapping plugin canvas, then there may be no need to see the Mapper rows each time they navigate to the Attributes stage.</li>
