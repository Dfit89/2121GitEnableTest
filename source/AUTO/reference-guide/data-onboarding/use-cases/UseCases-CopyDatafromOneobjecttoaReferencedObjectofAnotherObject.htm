        <h1>Use Cases - Copy Data from One Object to a Referenced Object of Another Object</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Because the Object to Object mapping plugin within the Onboarding Mappings Details screen has many uses for how the mappings can be configured,  describing the components within the mapper does not fully cover all of the functional use cases. With that in mind, two full use cases are described below that outline instances where this Object to Object Mapping plugin has been successfully implemented to copy data from one object to a referenced object of another object.</p>
        <h2>Example One</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The  requirement for this use case entails that the user has maintained part numbers (PIES Items) and Interchange objects (PIES Interchange objects) in the AutoCare Product hierarchy, but  also wants to create the PIES Interchange objects as Interchange objects in the NAPA product hierarchy and establish the reference from the NAPA part number ( NAPA Product) to the newly created interchange objects.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In this example, the AutoCare PIES Item 'JK21499'  is used as the Source object and NAPA Product 'RPC12345' as the Target object. All referenced Interchange objects of Source object 'JK21499' will be used to create new objects in the selected Target Parent Node  'Great Lakes' (existing (or can be created) within NAPA Interchange Product Hierarchy) and establish references from the Target object 'RPC12345' to the new objects. The Source object and the Target object is interlinked through the reference type 'PIES Item to NAPA Product' in the system.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Following are the detailed steps describing how to achieve the same via the mapping solution.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC"><b>Prerequisites</b>
        </p>
        <p>Create a new Product Reference Type to link the Source object PIES Item  to the Target object NAPA Product and establish the reference between the PIES Item to the NAPA Product. In this example, the  Product Reference Type 'PIES Item to NAPA Product' is defined to create a link between PIES Item  and NAPA Product. Below is the image displaying   hierarchy of Source object (JK21499), Target object (RPC12345), and the reference linking <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-08-21T22:08:21.2959039-04:00" MadCap:creator="danf" MadCap:initials="DANF" MadCap:comment="In regards to the image below -- we typically do not &quot;write&quot; on pictures because it will create an issue if the content is ever translated.

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Also, create a new Product Reference Type (or use the one that exists) to link the  Target object NAPA Product and newly created objects. In this example, the  existing Product Reference Type 'Product To Interchange Product' shall be used to create link between NAPA Product and newly created Interchange object (as shown below). For information about creating reference types and establishing references, see the <b>Reference Types</b> topic within the <b>System Setup / Super User Guide</b> documentation in <b>STEP Online Help</b><MadCap:xref href="../../../../../System Setup/Reference and Link Types/References/Reference Types.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/116.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In the Web UI, create and configure the Mapper Configuration and define the Source and Target objects and the Reference type to follow to determine the relationship between the Source and Target object.  For more information on configuring and setup procedure for the Mapper Configuration, see topic <b>Configuring Mapper Configuration Setup Entity</b> within this guide<MadCap:xref href="../Configuring Mapper Configuration Setup Entity.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Data Onboarding/86.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Configure an Initiate Business Action button within the Product Details screen of the Source object which shall execute the Mapper Configuration.
