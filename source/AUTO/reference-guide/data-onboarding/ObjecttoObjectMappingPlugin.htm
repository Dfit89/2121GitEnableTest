        <h1>Object to Object Mapping Plugin</h1>
        <p>Object to Object Mapping plugin will copy the information  present on the Source object or from its related object (Source STEP Path) to the Target object or to its related object. The information retrieved from the Source object could be the ID, name, attribute values, or references. The information from the Source object could be stored directly on Target object, as the child of the Target object, or as the referenced object of the Target object. The Object to Object Mapping plugin is added and configured in the Onboarding Mappings Details Screen for the selected Mapper Configuration.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To configure the Object to Object Mapping plugin, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>With the   required Mapper Configuration selected, click on <b>New mapping</b> which is available on the Mappings tab of  the Onboarding Mappings Details screen.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select Object to Object Mapping, and a screen displays prompting the user to further configure  the plugin. Below is a screenshot of the Mappings tab on the Onboarding Mappings Details screen. The steps required to configure the Object to Object Mapping are denoted with a number in the screenshot. Below the screenshot is a numbered list that describes each step, corresponding to the number shown in the image.</li>

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>Child:</b> Selecting this option will evaluate the Source STEP Path in order to get the data to be used to create child objects below the Target object. The child objects that are created can either be Classification or Product objects. The data that is retrieved from the Source object can be used in the new objects as an ID, Name, attribute value, or reference. The object type to be used for the new children objects that will be created below the Target object  must already exist. This object type is what will be selected in the Object Type parameter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body3">When this option is selected, the Reference Type and Parent Node parameters are grayed out and are <b>not</b> used with the Child Mapping type. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet3"><b>Reference:</b> Selecting this option will evaluate the STEP Path on the Source object to create new objects below another object, and then establish a reference between the Target object and the newly created object. The data that is retrieved from the Source object can be used in the new objects as an ID, Name, attribute value, or reference. The new object can be created under any node (called as Parent Node) and then a reference is established between the Target object and the new object. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Object Type:</b> This parameter is used when either the Child or Reference Mapping option is selected within the 'Mapping type' parameter.

        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Reference Type:</b> This parameter is  used when Reference Mapping option is selected within the 'Mapping type' parameter. This parameter allows the user to select the Reference Type that should be used to establish the reference between the Target object and the newly created objects. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Parent Node:</b> This parameter is only used when Reference Mapping option is selected within the 'Mapping type' parameter. The user can select the parent node under which the newly created objects will reside. </li>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Condition:</b> This parameter is used when either the Child or Reference Mapping option is selected within the 'Mapping type' parameter. The user can select a business condition that gets executed when the associated Mapper Configuration  setup entity is executed. This parameter will most often be used to define a business condition that decides whether the objects related to Target is to be created or not.</li>

The user also has the option to  select specific data points from  the Source object, or any of its related objects  by selecting a combination of the elements available in the Keywords field and thereby creating a STEP Validation path.

The specific combination of elements are chosen depending on the unique requirements for the data being retrieved. Selecting the  elements  will define the Source STEP Path which describes the path from which the source data must be retrieved. Depending on the element selected, further configurations may be required. In the example below, element <b>attribute[id:'[id]']</b> is selected and displays in the Validation Path field.

        <p>User can add any number of mapping rows in the mapping plugin. When there are multiple mapper rows available within the mapping plugin, the order of execution of each mapper row is based on the order in which it is listed within the mapping plugin.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The health of the  mapping row is displayed next to each mapping row. Users can also add some additional information describing each of the mapper rows.
