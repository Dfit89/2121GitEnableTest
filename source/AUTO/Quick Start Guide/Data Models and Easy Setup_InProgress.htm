        <h1>Data Models and Easy Setup</h1>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU plan to add this to the beginning of the Quick Start Guide. Also need to link to this topic from the Configuring Application Manager topic. Potentially move the section 'own model considerations' to this topic.</p>
        <p>Within the Automotive solution, data models exist for AutoCare, NAPA, and TecDoc standards. When Easy Setup actions outlined in this guide are completed, many of the configurations for each of the standards are automatically configured within the 'Automotive - Application Model' within Workbench &gt; System Setup &gt;Component Models. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The Easy Setup actions are not designed to provide a complete solution, but rather give admin users a jump start on completing many of the necessary configurations. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Optionally, an Own data model can be configured, however Easy Setup actions do not exist for this. </p>
