        <h1>Import Workflow Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When a file is loaded through an automotive importer, a STEP entity is created that represents the file, and then the entity (referred to as the controller) is initiated into a workflow. This section provides an overview of the default Automotive Import workflow. </p>
        <p class="Image1">

        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Each workflow can be extended to accomplish additional processing and/or reporting activities specific to any customer. Therefore, you may notice additional states (or additional activities occurring within the default states) on your system. </p>
        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Validation state does some basic schema validation of the file. If the standard supplies an XSD, the file format is validated against the XSD. If an XSD is not provided by the standard, the file is loosely validated to ensure the format conforms to what is expected for the file type. If the file fails validation, it will move to the Error state and will remain there until a user takes action on it. Files that successfully complete validation (with no errors or with only non-fatal errors) will move automatically to the Conversion state.</p>
        <h2>Conversion</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Conversion state converts the original file into a series of STEPXML files that include the full dataset from the import file.  If the import file fails conversion, it will move to the Error state and will remain there until a user takes action on it. Files that successfully complete conversion (with no errors or with only non-fatal errors) will move automatically to the Delta Calculation state.</p>
        <h2>Delta Calculation</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Delta Calculation state evaluates the converted files against either the database or the previously loaded converted files of that type (depending on the configuration of the delta calculation method for the import) and generates a set of delta files for import. Any existing data that would be unchanged by the import is omitted from the delta files as a means of increasing performance of the actual import. If the file fails delta calculation, it will move to the Error state and will remain there until a user takes action on it. Files that successfully complete delta calculation (with no errors or with only non-fatal errors) will move automatically to the Ready for Import state. </p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information, see the <b>Delta Calculation State</b> topic within the <b>Importing Automotive Data</b> section of this guide<MadCap:xref href="../../../Reference Guide/Importers/Default Workflow States and Functions/Delta Calculation State.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Error</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Files that have failed validation, conversion, or delta calculation will end up in the Error state. From there, the errors can be reviewed and the file can be discarded. Note that it is not possible to do further processing of the file after it has failed, though it can be subsequently reloaded.</p>
        <h2>Ready for Import</h2>
        <p class="Body1">When a file has successfully completed validation, conversion, and delta calculation, it will be available in the Ready for Import state, which is the first state in which user interaction is required for successful files. If customer-specific reporting has been added to the implementation, it is likely that reports can be viewed in this state. Whether or not reporting has been added, the Ready for Import state is where the user must decide whether to import or reject the file. If the user rejects the file, it will be moved to the Rejected state. If the user chooses to import the file, it is moved to the Import state.</p>
        <h2>Rejected</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Rejected state displays files that have successfully completed all pre-import processing, but have been deemed unacceptable for import by a user, usually due to data issues. A rejected file cannot be imported unless it is reloaded, so the only option to act on a file in this state is to discard it.</p>
        <h2>Import</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Import state carries out the actual import of the delta calculation files. When complete, the file is automatically moved to the Import Completed state.</p>
        <h2>Import Completed</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Upon completion of the import, the file will be assigned a 'completed' or 'completed with errors' status. If errors are present, they can be reviewed in this state. Files may be left in the Import Completed state or discarded. In either case, no further processing of the file occurs unless additional customer-specific processing states have been added.</p>
        <h2>Discard File</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Sending a file to the Discard File state  removes it from the workflow. It does not delete any data from STEP or the application server, unless customer-specific processing has been added to the state to do so.</p>
