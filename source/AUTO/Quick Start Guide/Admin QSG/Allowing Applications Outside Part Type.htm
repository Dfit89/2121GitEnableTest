        <h1>Allowing Applications Outside Part Type</h1>
        <p class="Body1">When using an Application Editor, if a part number is found using the part type search, but the part number is being applicated to a part type that differs from the one used to search, an error dialog will display informing the user that the part cannot be linked because the part type is different. In other words, when using the application editor to applicate parts, a parts part type must match the applications part type.</p>
        <p class="Body1">However, it is possible to override this, allowing users to select a part number with a part type that does not match the part type searched for application. In other words, the Application Editor will ignore the searched part type when assigning the part number to the application. This is helpful when working with a part that can only have a single part type, but can be applicated for multiple part types.</p>
