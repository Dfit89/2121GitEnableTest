        <h1>6. Update Assignees in Import Workflows</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Each import process has a corresponding workflow and all workflows are created with a default assignee of 'stepsys.' The workflows can be found under the Workflows node of the System Setup tab:</p>
        <p class="Image1">

            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1"> Each workflow must have the assignees updated to appropriate users or groups, either by defining a new default assignee for the workflow, or by removing the existing default and applying specific assignees per state.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Any users with the 'STEP Workflow Administrator' setup action as part of their privileges will be able to see and work with files in all states of the workflows. To quickly get up and running with the import functionality, it may be useful to add admin users to a group that contains this privilege, allowing those users to familiarize themselves with the workflow functionality while end user privileges are determined. </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The workflow administrator privilege can be applied to a setup group. If end users should be able to access data and take action in all states of the import workflows, the import workflows can be placed in a setup group and users who need to import the files can be added to a user group that contains the privilege applied to the applicable setup group. This will allow users to have full access to the import functionality, but only for those workflows in the setup group, leaving their access in other workflows unchanged.</p>
