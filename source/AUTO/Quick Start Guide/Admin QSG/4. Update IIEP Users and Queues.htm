        <h1>4. Update IIEP Users and Queues</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Each file type supported by the solution has a corresponding inbound integration endpoint. Each endpoint is created with the user who ran the "2. [Standard] Configure Import Process" setup action (within the Easy Setup for the standard) as the executing user of the endpoint. In addition, each endpoint is set up to run using the default endpoint process queue (In). The endpoints can be found under the Inbound Integration Endpoints node on the System Setup tab:</p>

        <h2>Configuration Steps</h2>
        <p class="Body1">While not strictly required, it is recommended to adjust the configuration of each endpoint as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1"> It is recommended that a unique user be assigned to each endpoint for auditing purposes. To update the user for each endpoint, right-click on the endpoint and select <b>Edit Inbound Integration Endpoint</b>. This will open the first step of the integration endpoint wizard, which contains a <b>User</b> parameter. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body2">For example, a 'PIES Import' user could be created and selected as the user for the AutoCare PIES Inbound Endpoint. </p>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Each implementation should determine how queues should be configured for the system. High priority endpoints and those with long running processes should typically have their own queue. To adjust the queue configuration on any endpoint, select the endpoint and click the <b>Edit Configuration</b> link. Then enter a value in the <b>Queue for endpoint processes</b> parameter. It is advisable to name the queue something comparable to the endpoint name so that the queue can be clearly identified by the system administrators.</li>
