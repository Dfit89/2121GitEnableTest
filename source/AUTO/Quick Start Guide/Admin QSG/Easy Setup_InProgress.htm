        <h1>Easy Setup Actions</h1>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: MEDU Easy setup is commonly referenced in RN and the Automotive Documentation. I think we need to explain what it is and how to access. </p>
        <p>The solution includes functionality to auto-create
all objects, references, attributes, workflows, etc., required to support the solution.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The point of the Easy Setup Actions is not to provide a fully functional system, that is the work of the implementation team, but rather to automatically create many of the object types, import framework, business conditions, workflows, attributes, reference types needed to begin an implementation. Easy Setup is especially helpful when implementing an automotive standard like AutoCare, NAPA, and/or TecDoc.</p>
