        <h1>Displaying  More States in Controller Screen</h1>
        <p class="Body1">The Easy Setup action is set to display a default of four workflow states within the Import Details section in the Controller Screen. If the user insists to view the status of the Controller, for example, time elapsed in passing the Controller through different states, status of the Controller in the particular state, etc., in all the workflow states it is passing through, the user can add or remove the states that need to be displayed. Thus, the number of workflow states that could be displayed within the Import Details Section of the  Controller screen  of any importer are configurable. This topic describes the detailed procedure on adding or removing the workflow states displayed in the Import Details section within the Controller screen for the selected importer.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For the ease of explanation, we have considered AutoCare ACES Importer Controller screen as an example to configure throughout this topic.</p>

        <h2>Adding States within Import Details section in Controller screen</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Below are the steps to add states within Import Details section in Controller screen.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Open the Web UI Designer and using the screen dropdown in the upper left of the designer pane, select the workflow screen you would like to edit.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">In the Automotive solution, by default a particular workflow screen is set to display as the screen a user will get to see after clicking on Controller in the table. This is one of the Node List configurable feature. Hence, the adding / removing of the workflow states is to be done in the particular workflow screen and not in the controller screen.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Click the <b>go to component</b> link for the Node Editor component.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">Double-click the <b>Refreshable Node List</b> component to open the Refreshable Node List Properties. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">In the dropdown next to Data Provider field, select  'Workflow State NodeList data provider' option and then click Edit. The 'Workflow State NodeList data provider properties' window displays.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2">

        </p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">All the existing default workflow states that were available for display gets erased when the user selects different data provider in the Data Provider parameter. The user needs to add all the required workflow states as described below to display the existing default workflow states too. </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">In the dropdown next to the Workflow parameter, select the workflow which the user needs to edit. In this example, AutoCare ACES importer workflow 'AutoCareACESAppImport' is selected.</li>

        </p>
        <p class="Body2">The selected workflow state will be populated in the States field as shown below. In the example below, the Import state is added to display.</p>
