        <h1>Adjusting Homepage Import Status Selectors</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Easy Setup creates a number of workflows to manage imports, along with a corresponding Web UI homepage widget, in this case, astatus selector, for each import. Each workflow contains a number of states, though not all are reflected in the corresponding status selector in Web UI. Specifically, the initial Validation and Conversion states are omitted as these states do not produce any interesting results for the end user if completed successfully. If errors are encountered, they can be viewed via the Error state. Whether successful or in error, transition out of these states is automatic so no user intervention is needed. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Furthermore, as described in the subsequent section, some implementations will likely choose to add additional states to the workflow which could produce an interesting result for the end user, such as a Reporting state. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Whether it is needed to display additional existing states or to display new ones, it may be necessary to adjust the configuration of the status selectors to display additional states. If so, detailed documentation for configuring status selectors is available in the <b>Status Selector Homepage Widget</b> topic within the <b>Workflows in Web UI</b> section of the <b>Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation of STEP Online Help<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Workflows in Web UI/Getting Started/Status Selector Homepage Widget.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
