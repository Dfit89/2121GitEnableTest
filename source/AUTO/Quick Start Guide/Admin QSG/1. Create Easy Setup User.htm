        <h1>1. Create Easy Setup User</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This setup action is not required, but is strongly recommended. The solution includes functionality to auto-create all objects, references, attributes, workflows, etc., required to support the solution. The user executing the auto-create functions (described in subsequent steps) will be recorded as the creator / editor of those objects in STEP. It is therefore recommended that a new user be created for this purpose, so that an accurate audit trail is in place. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The user must be created as a Super User without any privilege restrictions. For example:</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/QS/EasySetupUserPrivileges.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Additional information on managing users and privileges is available in the <b>STEP Online Help</b>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The admin user managing the initial setup of the system should log in using this newly created user before carrying out the following actions.</p>
