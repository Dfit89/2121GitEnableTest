        <h1>5. Update Delete Status Attribute and Delta Calculation Method in Import Workflows</h1>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Setup actions 5 - 8 are all carried out within the workflows and do not need to be done sequentially. Therefore, you can make all changes within a given workflow simultaneously to avoid opening and editing each workflow repeatedly.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: The reason that the delete information is here is because you would reasonably expect the system to carry out deletions if the file indicates it, but it does not carry out deletions. So that has to be explained early to users as otherwise the import doesn’t function as expected.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Each workflow has a Delta Calculation state where the system evaluates the content of the import file as compared to the content of the database, or against the previously loaded file of that type. For data that is determined to require deletion, the importer does not actually delete the data, but instead writes to an attribute that the data <i>should</i> be deleted. This allows each customer to determine their own strategy for managing deletions, such as processing the deletions via a workflow. </p>
        <p class="Body1">In order to enable the system to indicate data for deletion, the attribute to be used to hold the deletion information must be specified. A single attribute can be used for all imports, or unique attributes can be created to store deletion status for varying objects or imports. In either case, when an importer determines that data should be deleted, it writes 'true' in the attribute indicated in the <b>Delete status attribute</b> of the delta calculation service of that importer. Additionally, the system must be configured to process imports by comparing the incoming file against the database, or by comparing it against the previously loaded file of that type. For more information about implementing one or more delete status attributes (also known as change flags), see the <b>Business Action: Set Import Status Attributes</b> topic within the <b>Automotive Business Rule Plugins</b> section of the <b>Automotive Reference Guide</b><MadCap:xref href="../../Reference Guide/Business Rules/Business Action Set import status attributes.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Configuration Steps</h2>
        <p class="Body1" style="font-weight: normal;">Below are the steps necessary to specify the delta calculation method and the delete status attribute in any import workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Create an attribute (or verify that one exists) that can be used to store the delete status of an object. The attribute should be valid for the object(s) being managed by the import. For example, an attribute used in the AutoCare ACES Application Importer must be valid on ACES Application objects. Alternatively, an attribute used in the AutoCare PCdb Importer must be valid on all nodes in the PCdb classification hierarchy.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Select a workflow, right-click, and select <b>Edit STEP Workflow</b>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Double click on the <b>Delta Calculation</b> state to open the State Editor. Select the <b>On Entry</b> tab and click the Edit icon on the existing business rule.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1">In the Edit Operation dialog, <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-07-19T10:09:16.7359443-04:00" MadCap:creator="krma" MadCap:initials="KR" MadCap:comment="See RDCUST-2335 as this should be changed to a dropdown, and 'context' should be changed to 'database'.\r\n\r\nMEDU:  As of 10 May 2018 This is not planned for DEV.  \r\n\r\nBOND: As of 07 March 2019 This is not planned for development."

        </ol>

        <h3>Delta calculation methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>context:</b> Compares the data in the input file against the data in the database. It is recommended to use this option only as needed, which is when data is managed outside of the import process, or when import files of that type contain varying data sets. Oftentimes this method is required for supplier data. This method takes longer to process, but ensures accuracy when data management strictly via import cannot be guaranteed, or when datasets vary within the file type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body2">For example, because ACES files can come from multiple sources (Suppliers or Brands), it is required that the files are imported using 'context' method for delta calculation so that the data is compared against the database instead of the previously imported file. For this reason, Easy Setup configures the 'Delta calculation method' parameter with 'context' for the AutoCare ACES Import workflow.</p>
        <p class="Body2" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Additionally, PIES imports may be received from various suppliers providing data for different sets of parts. If the context method is used, each file is compared to the data in the database and any data not in the latest PIES file will be marked for deletion, which is not desired when different data sets are being used.</p>
        <p class="Body2" style="font-weight: normal;" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">For example, PIES imports may be received from various suppliers providing data for different sets of parts. If the 'file' method is used, then each new PIES file will be compared to the previous PIES file, and any data not in the new PIES file will be marked for deletion, causing conflicting and undesired results when different data sets are imported. (i.e., If Supplier 1's import file contains data for PIES&#160;Item 'X,' but Supplier 2's import file does not contain data for PIES Item 'X,' then PIES&#160;Item 'X' should not be marked for deletion, but if the 'file' method is used, then PIES Item 'X' would be deleted. However, using the 'context' method resolves this, because each Suppliers file is compared to the existing data in the database, instead of the previous import file.)  </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">The context method is required for the following: AutoCare ACES Import Workflow (because of the ACES Complete Replacement functionality<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">, whether or not the data is managed strictly via import</MadCap:conditionalText>), NAPA Application Import workflow, and NAPA&#160;Interchange Import workflow. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>file:</b> Compares the data in the input file against the data in the last loaded file of the same type. It is recommended to use this option whenever possible as it has a performance advantage over the context method. The file method is suitable for any format where the data is managed strictly via import and contains consistent data sets, as is often the case for reference data. </li>
        </ul>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/File Method for Delta Calculation.flsnp" />
        <p class="Body2">For example, a PCdb file always contains all data for the PCdb. If a part terminology is not present in the current file, it is because it has been removed from the PCdb. Using either the file or the context method would result in the missing part terminology being appropriately marked for deletion, but as the data set is consistent and usually only managed via import, the file method is preferred to take advantage of the faster processing time.</p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">The above action of setting the delete status attribute serves only to configure the attribute that will store the deletion. Each implementation should further determine a process for managing deletions for each import.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">  If users want to track new / change / delete flags for PIES objects as well as use replacement rules to update PIES attribute values and data container values, the PIES importer Delta calculation method parameter must be set to <b>'context'</b>. And if users want to track only the new or changed objects (without deleted objects), and also use replacement rules, the PIES importer Delta calculation method parameter must be set to <b>'file'</b>. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The PIES Importer can mark only the PIES Item, PIES Package, and PIES HazMat objects for deletion. PIES Interchange objects will not be handled to be marked for deletion<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"> because interchange objects are shared between multiple suppliers. </MadCap:conditionalText>. Also, the PIES Product Hierarchy objects (PIES Brand / PIES PCdb Category / PIES PCdb Sub Category / PIES PCdb Part Terminology) will not be handled to be marked for deletion<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">because those objects could be shared by multiple PIES imports</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
