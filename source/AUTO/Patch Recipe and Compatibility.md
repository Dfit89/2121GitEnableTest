Patch Recipe and Compatibility
==============================

The Automotive 9.2 add-on can be installed with the following recipe:

[to:automotive/7.0/automotive-7.0.21.spr]{.commandfont}

The above recipe is only compatible with the STEP 9.2-MP1 baseline
([to:step/trailblazer/step-9.2-mp1.spr]{.commandfont}).

**PRODOC note: MEDU PRODOC- 1572** Once an Automotive add-on is
installed to a base STEP system, the base system should not be upgraded
without upgrading the Automotive add-on at the same time. Additionally,
when upgrading any base STEP system that has any Automotive add-on
installed, both install recipes must be prepared at the same time.

For assistance in applying the patch to systems with extensions or
additional add-on components, contact Stibo Systems Technical Services.
