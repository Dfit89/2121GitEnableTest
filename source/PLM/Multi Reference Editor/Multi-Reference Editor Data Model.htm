        <h1>Multi-Reference Editor Data Model</h1>
        <p>The data model for Multi-Reference Editor is based in Product-to-Product references.</p>
        <p>In this model example, there are   two source objects (Design Specification Variant and Sample) and one  target object (Requirement). Both source and target objects are products. The reference connecting the objects is a Product Reference Type. An example of attributes valid on the reference and the target objects listed below the reference / object is pictured below.</p>
