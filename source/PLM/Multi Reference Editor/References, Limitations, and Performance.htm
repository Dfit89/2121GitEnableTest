        <h1>References, Limitations, and Performance</h1>
        <p>This topic details how to remove references as well as any limitations or performance considerations when working with the Multi-Reference Editor.</p>
        <h2>Remove Reference</h2>
        <p>This  functionality will remove the selected reference to Requirements or Parameters.</p>
        <p>In the private label food solution, some requirements are used in 90% of projects.  Once the user has started the revision process, some references to requirements or parameters must be deleted.</p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>The only attribute validation base type(s) that are supported in the current React components are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>Text</li>
            <li>ISO Date</li>
            <li>LOV (single and multi-valued)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Only the edit mode is supported.</p>
        <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
        <p>A lot of business actions / functions are executed in the new 'Create Reference' and 'Edit Reference' dialogs. The performance will depend on how the business actions / functions are configured.</p>
