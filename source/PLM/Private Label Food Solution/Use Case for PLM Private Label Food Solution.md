Use Case for PLM Private Label Food Solution
============================================

The following use case illustrates how the PLM private label food
solution can help to specify and source your products as well as how to
sell them with your own label.

CIBUS Company\'s Private Label Project Use Case
-----------------------------------------------

The CIBUS company is a global food brand which markets and sells largely
to North America, Europe, and Latin America. CIBUS sells directly to its
consumers via local supermarkets, convenience stores, and various
channels.

The merchandiser team has conducted market research about favorite and
popular ready-made combinations meals -- not ready-to-eat food trends.
CIBUS findings were that more consumers want \'free-from\' products.
Food and beverages free of ingredients that contain artificial colors
and flavors, preservatives and GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) are
the new preferences of consumers. After evaluating the market research
results, the merchandiser team decided to add a new private label
product, called Macaroni & Cheese, to their ready-made combinations
meals -- not ready-to-eat product line.

1.  The initial phase is programmed to sell the Macaroni & Cheese
    products in the United States. In a future phase, the Macaroni &
    Cheese products will be introduced to Canada, Europe, and Latin
    America markets.

To continue with the private label Macaroni & Cheese project, the
merchandiser team will complete a competitive analysis to identify
competitor product characteristics such as:

-   Brand
-   Competitor Product Price
-   Net Content Options
-   Competitor Product Claims
-   Competitive Product Ingredient
-   Competitive Product Packaging Description

After five competitive products were analyzed, the merchandising and
quality teams decided to continue with the private label Macaroni &
Cheese project.

2.  Macaroni & Cheese will be available in two product variations:
    Original and Spirals Pasta. Each variation will be offered in the
    packaging size 7.25 oz (206g).
3.  To ensure that the  Macaroni & Cheese products will capture consumer
    preferences, the merchandising and quality teams have identified the
    following deferential factors that will impact the consumer
    decision:

-   Need to improve upon competitors\' product quality
-   Competitor product pricing
-   Specify package size and label
-   Packaging detailed description
-   Specify if a product is suitable for a diet
-   Specify all organic ingredients
-   Identify if it is a \'free-from\' product

4.  As part of the initiative to improve product quality, the
    merchandising team decided to adopt a system to specify product
    ingredients, labels, and package requirements for the project. This
    system will provide a detailed view of each of the specifications
    needed for the product and act as a source to validate and guarantee
    that all regulations are satisfied.

The product specification system will include the following
functionalities:

-   Create a detailed recipe specification and be able to select which
    ingredient can or cannot be contained in the product recipe, as well
    as be able to specify the minimum or maximum quantities allowed in
    the product recipe
-   Specify the food\'s physical and chemical properties, and
    microbiological limits for testing parameters for the recipe
-   Specify the requirements for the recipe, packages, and labels
-   Handle products with composite recipes

Adopting the product specification system will also provide a tool to
enhance the supplier selectivity process and:

-   Have a coordinated and detailed sampling, process, and functionality
    to request a recipe specification, label specification, and
    packaging specification to prospective suppliers
-   Can compare and rank supplier responses and award the product that
    meets the quality and standard food requirements
-   Collect additional product information from the supplier such as:
    Nutritional Values, Declaration of Allergens, Certificates (Non-GMO,
    Organic Certified), Preparation Instructions, and Handling
    Statements
-   Establish a response period and be able to request further
    information from the supplier when it is needed

To accomplish label regulations established in some of the countries
where CIBUS plans to sell the product, and to achieve cost efficiencies
for the production of the packaging, labels will be printed in multiple
languages.

The food label needs to describe specific amounts contained in each
package, and display information printed in one or more languages for
each market where the Macaroni & Cheese will be sold. As a competitive
advantage, products sold in the United States will have labels printed
in English and Spanish, whereas products sold in Canada will have labels
in English and French to accommodate law requirements.

A quality manager and a purchasing manager will review and validate that
all necessary label requirements are specified.

5.  Another important factor to ensure compliance is to have a
    traceability record for each ingredient in the recipe. Knowing the
    country of origin will help to validate, search, and follow-up
    recall.
6.  Once all specifications are completed, prospective suppliers can be
    selected and specifications (recipe, label, and packaging) will be
    sent to each one.

Suppliers will have the ability to specify recipes, packages, and
labels. Additionally, suppliers will need to:

-   Add all ingredients used in the recipe proposal and see the
    ingredients specified by customer
-   Answer specified requirements and parameters for recipe proposal
-   Answer specified requirements for label proposal
-   Answer specified requirements for packaging proposal

The solution will provide suppliers with a feature to execute quick
validations between their specified ingredients and ingredients detailed
in the project. This reduces the back-and-forth communication time and
helps the supplier to respond with the best offering that will meet the
needs of the company.

7.  The solution enables quality and purchasing teams to evaluate
    supplier responses by comparing the responses received from
    suppliers, and rank suppliers\' proposals for each specification
    based on their evaluation.
8.  The purchasing team will review the evaluated and ranked responses
    received from suppliers and must decide which supplier(s) to award
    the contract to based on their ranking and on a combination of
    recipes and packaging that they are able to produce for delivery in
    specific countries.
9.  The solution will include a library recipe based on the number of
    awarded recipes for a project.
10. To keep a record of the sourcing process, a finalized project file
    must be preserved. Project-related objects for suppliers that were
    not awarded the contract must be deleted.
11. An important benefit of having the projects in the same system with
    the PMDM product is that for each of the awarded PLM labels, a PMDM
    product will be created and started in the PMDM New Product
    introduction workflow.

With the implementation of the specification process for the private
label food solution, the merchandising and quality teams expect the
following benefits:

-   Increase in sourcing efficiencies
-   Increase in product quality
-   Standardization of recipe specifications
-   Reduction of cost
-   Fast time to market
-   Allow for product ingredients traceability
-   Reduction in process time since suppliers can do an ingredients
    quick validation
-   Supplier selection through an evaluation process
-   Increase in visibility of the status of each specification and the
    corresponding supplier response
-   Ability to cancel any requests to suppliers who have not responded
    in time
-   Ability to cancel one or more of the specifications because of
    changing business needs
