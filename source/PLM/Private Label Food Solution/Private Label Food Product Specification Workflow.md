Private Label Food Product Specification Workflow
=================================================

PRODOC note: The tables in this topic are all images. This was a
conscious decision as it was just too much to put in the tables in
Flare, and with all of the merge cells, and the many tables needed it
was too much to put in manually. Additionally, the tables were not
playing nicely with one another and merging all the time.

The Private Label Food Product Specification Workflow allows for the
independent design and evaluation of recipes, packaging, and label
variants. The workflow will allow users to see task lists for pieces
that need specifications and also enables for evaluation of supplier
responses by comparing the responses. Suppliers proposals for each
specification are ranked based on their evaluations.
