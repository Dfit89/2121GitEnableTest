Food Terminology for PLM Private Label Food Solution
====================================================

The following are terms commonly used in the private label food
industry:

Private Label
-------------

Private label products or services, which include a wide range of goods
and services such as food, cosmetics, web hosting, etc., are often
manufactured or provided by one company but are for sale under another
company\'s brand. The agreement between the manufacturer and the
retailer governs their relationship.

The appeal of private label products to private-label buyers is that
they are easy to produce in large volumes and are inexpensive to
manufacture, generating extra profit without a lot of extra work. Should
sales begin to drop, the private-label buyer can stop buying and
re-selling the product.

The greatest challenges of the food industry are the competitive market,
the fact that each food product needs to meet a set of sanitary and
quality requirements, and the need for each ingredient to satisfy
specific quality testing parameters.

Recipe
------

There are different concepts and definitions about a food recipe. For
example, a recipe is a list of food ingredients and a sequence of
instructions that describe how to combine them to obtain a new product
or an ingredient. When using the term \'food ingredient,\' it includes
food additives, which are substances added to foods for specific
technical and/or functional purpose during processing, storage or
packaging.

There are distinct types of ingredients in the food area. To explore
each ingredient type, review the following food recipe example.

The recipe for Macaroni and Cheese ingredients is a compound recipe
which includes two recipes: one for Enriched Macaroni and one for Cheese
Sauce Mix.

Recipe for Macaroni and Cheese:

-   Enriched Macaroni:
-   Wheat Flour

Additives
---------

Additives are substances, either occurring naturally or man-made, that
are intentionally added to food -- usually in small quantities -- to
assist in its processing or to improve certain characteristics. Some
characteristics it can improve are:

-   aroma
-   color
-   consistency
-   taste
-   texture
-   packaging
-   shelf life.

Normally, they are never consumed as a food itself, nor are they used as
individual food ingredients. Additives are not considered nutritional
even if they have some nutritive value, and the same additive can be
used for many different purposes.

A few additive examples are:

-   **Preservatives**: ascorbic acid, calcium sorbate, and sodium
    nitrite
-   **Color additives**: fruit and vegetable juices, yellow 5, and
    beta-carotene
-   **Flavors and spices**: \'real\' vanilla or \'artificial\' vanilla

E Numbers
---------

E numbers, where the \'E\' stands for \'Europe,\' are codes for
substances that are permitted to be used as food additives within the
European Union and European Food Safety Authority (EFTA). Commonly found
on food labels, their approval and safety assessments are the
responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority.

INS Number
----------

International Numbering System (INS) numbers are an international
numerical system agreed upon and assigned by the Codex Alimentarius
committee to identify each food additive. INS numbers generally
correspond to E numbers for the same compound, for example, INS 102,
Tartrazine, is also E102. INS numbers are not unique, and in fact, one
number may be assigned to a group of like compounds.
