Workflows for PLM Private Label Food Solution
=============================================

A series of four workflows are used to manage the process of designing
and selecting suppliers for a new private label food introduction. This
series of workflows manage a single project concept. The concept may be
for a recipe having multiple flavor variations and multiple packaging
configurations to be sold in more than one country -- each having its
own product label languages and requirements.

Although separate workflows are used, communication between them is
critical to track the progress of the various pieces used to handle the
specifications and the suppliers' responses. For this, a series of
status attributes are used to provide a view of the progress of the
related specifications and supplier responses.

Separate but integrated workflows are used to handle different objects
in the process, and the specific processes for them are:

-   The common aspects of the product on Design Specification, which
    represents the entire project.

-   The specifications for variants of recipe, packaging, and labels.

-   The suppliers' responses to the specifications for recipes,
    packaging, and labels.

-   Track the status of the supplier's responses after they have been
    submitted to the customer

Status updates between the three workflows must take place throughout so
that the progress of work on recipes and packaging is visible at the
overall project level, the status of suppliers' responses is visible for
each recipe and packaging specification, and the status of each
supplier's work is visible at the response level.
