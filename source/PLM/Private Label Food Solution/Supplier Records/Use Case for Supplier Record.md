Use Case for Supplier Record
============================

Laura, from the Supplier A team, is responsible for answering the Recipe
Response requests received from the customer, CIBUS (Buyer). Laura
accesses the Supplier Web UI, opens the Chocolate Cookie Project Dark
Chocolate Chip A12345 (Recipe Response), and starts the process of
completing the requested information for the recipe ingredients,
requirements, and parameters.

For more information on the use case for the supplier user response, see
the **Use Cases for the Supplier User Response** topic in the **PLM
Change Reports Summary** segment of the **Product Lifecycle Management**
section of the **Solution Enablement** documentation[
here]{.mcFormatColor style="color: Blue;"}.

Laura completes the Dark Chocolate Chip A12345 (Recipe Response) and
clicks \'Send Response\' to send the bid to the customer, CIBUS (Buyer).

On transition out of the Initial Response state, named \'Supplier\', the
Dark Chocolate Chip A12345 (Recipe Response) is removed from Supplier
Response workflow. The Dark Chocolate Chip A12345 (Recipe Response) is
then initiated in the Supplier Bid Status workflow where suppliers can
continue to monitor the status of their open bids.

Immediately, the supplier user who submitted the Dark Chocolate Chip
A12345 (Recipe Response) receives an email with a copy of the bid
response, as shown below.
