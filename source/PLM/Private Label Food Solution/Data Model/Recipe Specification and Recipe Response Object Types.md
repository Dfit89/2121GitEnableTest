Recipe Specification and Recipe Response Object Types
=====================================================

The PLM private label food solution has two different uses for the food
recipe concept:

1.  A recipe specification is where the customer specifies ingredients
    and a set of requirements and quality standards.
2.  A supplier response is where suppliers will list all ingredients
    that are used to make up a finished product and where they will
    respond to the set of requirements and quality standards specified
    by the customer.

There are different types of ingredients in a recipe:

Ingredient
----------

An ingredient is a single element, part or substance used in a recipe
preparation.

Compound Ingredient
-------------------

A compound ingredient is an ingredient made up of multiple ingredients
and additives.

For example, Enriched Wheat Flour is made up of more than one
ingredient: Wheat Flour and Niacin.

Sub-Ingredient
--------------

A sub-ingredient is a part or compound of another ingredient.
