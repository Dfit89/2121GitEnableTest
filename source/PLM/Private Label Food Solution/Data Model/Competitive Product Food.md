Competitive Product Food
========================

A competitive product food represents similar products to the product
that a customer is evaluating for production. In the PLM private label
food solution, a competitive product food is used to collect relevant
information on similar products that already are on the market. Such
information collected to compare could include brands, pricing,
ingredients, product claims, and product images.

A competitive product can be added from a project. As a competitive
product food is added to the comparison, a competitive product food
object is created and linked to the project.
