Supplier Response Compound Ingredient
-------------------------------------

When a supplier adds ingredients to a recipe, they search the ingredient
library. When a compound ingredient is chosen, a copy of it is made as a
supplier response compound ingredient so that each supplier can add
their own sub-ingredients to it and so that parameters can be attached
to it without permanently attaching that parameter to the library
compound ingredient. Since parameters may be different based on how the
compound ingredient is used, this keeps the library ingredients neutral.

The private label food solution includes an ingredients classification,
where ingredients are classified into groups based on the food type.
