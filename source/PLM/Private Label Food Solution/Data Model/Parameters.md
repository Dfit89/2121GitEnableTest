Parameters
==========

Parameters set measurable laboratory testing thresholds for each
property and hold information about food quality that must be met for
the recipe. There are two different types of parameters,
Microbiological, and Physiochemical.

The PLM private label food solution data model includes a parameters
hierarchy where parameters are organized by parameter type. These are
based on GS1\'s valid values for the attributes Microbiological /
organismCode and PhysioChemical CharacteristicCode.

Customers are responsible for populating the thresholds according to
their standards. They are also responsible for providing help text to
suppliers and indicating any mandatory responses.
