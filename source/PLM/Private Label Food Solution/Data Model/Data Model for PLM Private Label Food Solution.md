Data Model for PLM Private Label Food Solution
==============================================

New product development from the firm's own research and development
team refers to original products, product improvements, product
modifications, and new brand development. For the private label food
solution, the work process starts after ideation, beginning with a
competitive analysis and ending after one or more suppliers are selected
to produce the products.

The PLM private label food solution provides a tool to manage the
product development process with a central repository for product
specifications. It also ensures the alignment of product specifications
with ingredients, requirements, quality testing parameters, labeling,
and packaging requirements. A series of objects are defined to handle
the different pieces of information required in the food product
development process. To see a detail definition of each object please
review the following data model documentation topics.
