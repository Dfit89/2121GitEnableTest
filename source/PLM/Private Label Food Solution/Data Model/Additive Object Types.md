Additive Object Types
=====================

In the PLM private label food solution, the additives (ingredients) are
defined by the following objects types.

Additive
--------

Additive represents an additive in the library. An additive can be a
natural or synthetic substance that is added to commercially prepared
foods for a specific purpose, such as a preservative, thickener, color
retention agent, etc.

Specified Additive
------------------

A specified additive is used by the developed components for specifying
additives. A user searches an additive library and chooses a class plus
an additive. A copy of the additive is saved as a specified additive.

Supplier Response Additive
--------------------------

A supplier response additive represents an additive used in the
supplier's recipe. A copy of an additive is made for each supplier who
then selects and adds the needed additive(s) for their recipe.

The private label food solution includes an additives library, where
food additives are classified by the function they serve in food
processing.
