        <h1>Business Actions and Snapshots</h1>
        <p>In PLM Private Label Solution Food, business rules are created and configured to determinate when the snapshot should take place. These business rules for snapshots can be applied to workflow transitions or any other event that supports executing business rules.</p>
        <p>In PLM Private Label Food solution, the PLM Food Supplier Snapshot business action is in use on the Initiate state of the Private Supplier Response workflow. When a Supplier Response (Recipe Response, Label Response, Packaging Response) is initiated in the workflow, a Snapshot will be created.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Customers are responsible for creating business rules since each customer has different needs</p>
