        <h1>Change Report Snapshot Overview</h1>
        <p>In STEP, historical versions of objects are stored as revisions, supplying a historical ‘snapshot’ of an object. For these revisions,  the minimum timing threshold is 24 hours, and a revision is made when the time is exceeded. This represents a limitation since during the collaboration process product data can experience multiples changes by different user roles in a short period of time.</p>
        <p>Snapshot Change Report is an alternative to STEP’s revisions. In short:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">A Change Report can detail any changes that have been made during user-defined events.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Static snapshots are taken and compared to the current data.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Customers define which data point(s) to capture and when.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">They support complex data models like a recipe and packaging specification, including reference metadata and nested references.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Data model changes will not remove data change history captured in the snapshots.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">A Change report snapshot will not be under revision control so it can be deleted at proper intervals, providing clean up to reduce object bloat.</li>
        </ul>
