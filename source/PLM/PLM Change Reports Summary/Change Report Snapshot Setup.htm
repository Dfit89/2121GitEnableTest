        <h1>Change Report Snapshot Setup</h1>
        <p>A Change Report Snapshot needs a series of configurations to be enabled. See below the configurations included in Private Label Food Change Report Snapshot functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a required data model for storing snapshot definitions and  snapshots.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">There is a required format for generating snapshots.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">There is a dependency on Product Summary Card. Change Report alerts will only appear on screens that are configured to use the Product Summary Card component.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">An add-on change-report component and license    must be installed on your system.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">A snapshot business rule bind is used to support snapshot recorders.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Business Rules are utilized. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Snapshot Data Model</h2>
        <p>The Change Report Snapshot is a fixed model. This model is for storing snapshot definitions and the snapshots created on data changes.</p>

        </p>
        <p>See the <b>Change Reports</b> documentation in the <b>Product Lifecycle Management</b> documentation for more information on the necessary objects, references, attributes, business rules, and snapshots needed for Change Reports Snapshots<MadCap:xref href="../../../PLM/PLM for Admins/Private Label Food Solution/Change Reports/Change Reports.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Snapshot Recorder Format</h2>
        <p>The Snapshot Recorder is a product object in STEP which stores a recorder text that defines which data must be captured in the snapshot. The format of the recorder text is a JSON string.</p>
        <p>The JSON property attributes value is an array of JSON Objects.</p>
        <p>For example, the JSON objects array is represented by:[{},{}]</p><pre>{</pre><pre>"attributes": [    "PLMDesignSpecificationDescription", "PLMSpecificationName"</pre><pre>]</pre><pre>}</pre>
        <p>In Private Label Food solution, Snapshots are organized in a one-level hierarchy :</p>

        </p>
        <p>Snapshot Recorders are linked to one or many Snapshot Configuration(s) using the product classification link type Snapshot Recorder (ID SnapshotRecorder). This enables the re-use of Snapshot Recorders on many screens where the same data should be captured.</p>
        <p>On the link between a Snapshot Recorder and a Snapshot Configuration are metadata attributes   that are used to define tabs in the Change Report (Web UI experience).</p>
