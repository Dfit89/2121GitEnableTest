        <h1>Snapshots</h1>
        <p>Snapshots are saved on classification objects in JSON strings. One snapshot is captured for each Snapshot Recorder that is linked to the Snapshot Configuration for the screen. A reference is created between the Snapshot and the Snapshot Configuration that created it.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Snapshot contains all of the data that was defined in the Snapshot Recorders configuration. The data of the Snapshot is organized by Recorder.</p>
        <p>A Snapshot Configuration reference is created from the snapshot classification to the desired Snapshot  Configuration.</p>
        <h2>Snapshot Configurations</h2>
        <p>Snapshot configurations are classifications kept in workbench, used for screens in Web UI, where they determine which contexts to capture data from, and any customer-defined change in events. This could be a change in a workflow state, a trigger by an inbound or outbound integration endpoint, or a change by derived events through an Event Processor. Once the defined change in an event has taken place, a snapshot recorder is used to help take note of the change and record any changes.</p>
