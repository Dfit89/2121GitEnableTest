        <h1>How a Change Report Works</h1>
        <p>Private label food out-of-the-box configuration includes a set of example configurations for capturing data changes in the Supplier Responses phase and Evaluation of the Supplier Responses.</p>
        <p>Change Reports detect any changes that have been made during user-defined events only   if the change has been defined in the recorder.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: Jan Sorensen says that the following sentence is correct when it says 'supplier response is sent to a supplier...'</p>
        <p>When a Supplier Response (Recipe Response, Label Response or Packaging Response) is sent to a Supplier to request his / her responses for Ingredients, Parameters, Requirements, and Nutrition Information, the Supplier Responses are initiated in the Private Label Food Supplier Response workflow.</p>
        <p>On entry to the Initiate state of the Private Label Food Supplier Response workflow, the PLM Food Supplier Snapshot business rule is executed, and the following actions will take place:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A Snapshot will be created. e.g., SAM183267-Supplier Response-12-07-19 13:51:49.</li>
            <li>The supplier will then start working on supplier responses and respond with any required information. When finished, they select 'Send Response' and send it back to the customer (Buyer).</li>
            <li>Once all Supplier Responses are received, all product specifications will be moved to the Evaluate Supplier Responses state of the Private Label Food Product Specification.</li>
            <li>If the supplier  completed all required information, it represents data changes so a new snapshot will be taken.</li>
            <li>When a customer (buyer) starts reviewing the Supplier Responses, changes between the snapshot and the current data are detected, and the Change Report notification will be visible and active.</li>
        </ol>
