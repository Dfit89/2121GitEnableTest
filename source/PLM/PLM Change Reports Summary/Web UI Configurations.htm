        <h1>Web UI Configurations</h1>
        <p>The Change Report Snapshot has been configured on an Evaluate Supplier Responses and Supplier Responses screens.</p>
        <p>To enable the Change Report functionality in the Web UI, the Product Summary Card is required. It is an out-of-the-box component that can be configured to show either a preselected grouping of product information or a series of data points configured by the user.</p>
        <h2>Product Summary  Card Component in Private Label Food screens</h2>
        <p>The Product Summary Card provides users a collection of product information display just below the screen title.</p>
        <p>Private Label Food and Private Label Food Supplier Web UIs are both configured with the Product Summary  Card component. It is a very helpful functionality to end-users since in the private label food solution different objects are used in a project, so different groups of information can be displayed based on the object in use, user role, and process state (task).</p>
        <p class="Body1">The following are examples of Primary Summary Card configurations in Private Label Food Solution.</p>
        <h3>Supplier Recipe Response</h3>

        </p>
        <h3>Supplier Label Response</h3>

        <h3>Supplier Packaging Response</h3>

        </p>
        <p>The Change Report component requires a license and is enabled in the Secondary Summary Card Section. Change Report component needs to be selected in the Secondary Summary Card and a Snapshot configuration specified.</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/PLM/webUI4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The Secondary Summary Card section has been configured with parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Show Change Report: Checkbox enabled to display the Change Report button to the right of the Product Summary.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Snapshot Configuration: (Snapshot configuration to be used). A parameter will be added to allow searching for a Snapshot Configuration. No other object types will be allowed.</li>
            <li>The Snapshot Configuration is used for the entire Web UI screen. It determines the contexts to capture data from and a customer-defined Event ID (e.g., supplier response or internal review) to identify the snapshot.</li>
            <li>Snapshot recorders can be created for each Web UI or for processing logic, workflow. They can be configured according to each customer requirements.</li>
            <li>On each snapshot recorder, on the Product to Classification Link Type 'SnapshotRecorder,' there are metadata attributes maintained. These determine factors about the Change Report so that each time the snapshot recorder is re-used, the information can be different.</li>
        </ul>
