Collaboration Workflow
======================

![](../../../Resources/Images/Solution%20Enablement/PMDM/PMDM%20For%20Retail/collabWorkflow.png)

The Vendor Data Onboarding configuration includes a collaboration
workflow which works in the same way as in the Product Content
Management Module.

The workflow uses the objects introduced in this module: Internal Source
Record, External Source Record, Golden Record.

With this workflow, the retailer's team can collaborate around product
data. This is an internal communication feature, which cannot include
external suppliers, using different systems.

For PDS, a communication channel is included in the onboarding workflow
to handle when the retailer accepts a supplier's product, rejects it, or
asks the supplier to have it reworked.
