Module - Vendor Data Onboarding
===============================

The Vendor Data Onboarding allows for multiple supplier-side products
for one retailer-side product (buy-side, sell-side). In this
configuration, the Suppliers onboard their data (while in the "Product
Content Management" module, the Retailer was onboarding the Product
Data). A distinction is made between the product data coming from the
suppliers (which may vary from one supplier to the other) and the
product data as maintained by the retailer.

The Source Records (or purchased product and sold product, or buy-side / sell side and other expressions)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While you may know about \'buy-side product,\' \'supplier product,\' and
\'vendor product,\' a more generic naming is relevant. Product data can
come from a supplier, but it can also come from a content provider (such
as GDSN, Salsify, etc.), so the term \'source record\' is used.

There are three types of Product Data, or "Source Records".
