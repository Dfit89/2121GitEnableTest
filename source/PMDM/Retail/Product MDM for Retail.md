Product MDM for Retail
======================

\'PMDM for Retail\' are starter packs or "modules" that allow you to
bootstrap your PMDM project. These are ready-to-use solutions, based on
the most commonly observed features in the market, and they can be
customized to meet your requirements.

Each pack contains:

-   A workable configuration (data model, WebUI, workflows, business
    rules, IEP, etc.)
-   Documentation

There are several packs or "modules", each covering different use cases:

-   Product Content Management (PCM) module
-   Vendor Data Onboarding (VDO) module
-   GDSN module, working in conjunction with VDO module

Each business is different---your processes, your products, your
organization. Implementing a PMDM (Stibo Systems' Product Master Data
Management solution) raises a lot of questions and can seem challenging.

As PMDM multi-domain specialists, Stibo Systems has studied customers\'
business processes and configurations and has identified patterns that
frequently occur in the retail industry.
