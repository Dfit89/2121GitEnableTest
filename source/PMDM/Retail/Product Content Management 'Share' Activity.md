Product Content Management \'Share\' Activity
=============================================

![](../../../Resources/Images/PMDM%20for%20Retail/PMDMShare.png)

Within the Product Content Management module, the \'share\' activity
includes an outbound integration endpoint (OIEP) that exports data in
the STEPXML format to a hotfolder. The targeted system then imports the
data and processes it.

The OIEP \'Products Outbound (PMDM.OIEP.ProductOutbound)\' is triggered
on each approval.
