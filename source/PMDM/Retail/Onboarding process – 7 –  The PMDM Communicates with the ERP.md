![](../../../Resources/Images/Solution%20Enablement/PMDM/PMDM%20For%20Retail/ERPOnboarding7.png)

When the Golden Record has passed the validation for ERP then the Golden
Record is sent to the "Products Outbound -- ERP\" Outbound Integration
Endpoint and the corresponding Internal Source Record is initiated in
the ERP Communication workflow which is used to handle the 2-ways
communication with the ERP system.

The export will be in STEPXML format and will contain the Golden Record,
all linked Source Records (Internal and External) plus all packaging
objects linked from the sources.
