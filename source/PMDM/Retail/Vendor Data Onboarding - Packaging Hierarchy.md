Vendor Data Onboarding - Packaging Hierarchy
============================================

If the product data received from PDS or GDSN contains packaging
information, then it will be created as a separate packaging object per
packaging hierarchy level. PMDM for Retail is pre-configured with
support for Pack, Case and Pallet which will be linked from the largest
unit to the smallest unit with the quantity of next lower package stored
as meta-data on the reference. The Each is represented by the External
Source Record.

The packaging objects are modeled as products in PMDM for Retail. They
will be categorized directly under either External Packaging or Internal
Packaging in the separate Packaging Hierarchy without further
categorization.

The Packaging Hierarchy can be viewed in a Product details page, in the
"Packaging Hierarchy" tab.
