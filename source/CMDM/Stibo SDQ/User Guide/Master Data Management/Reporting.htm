We use tasks when we want to remind ourselves or someone else about the activity that needs to be done. &#xD;&#xA;To create and assign Task first we need to find duplicate records for Account or Contact. In order to do that, we must go to Manual Merge Request Page, find duplicates, and then create new task." />

        <h1>Reporting</h1>
        <p>Stibo SDQ Reporting is displayed on the Stibo SDQ Home page once the MDM theme is configured,  and is the main entry point for Data Stewards who need remove duplicates using the Clerical Review and Manual Merge Requests functions. Reporting displays beneath the Clerical Review Tasks,  and provides an overview of performance factors pertaining to the automated deduplication that runs in the background.</p>
        <p>For each of the record types: Account, Contact and Person Account (if activated), two charts will be displayed:</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/User Guide/Reporting/Reporting Account Organizations Matching Overview.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/User Guide/Reporting Contacts.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/User Guide/Reporting/Reporting Person Accounts.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Matching Overview</h2>
        <p>The pie chart reports on records that have passed through the automatic matching and deduplication process in the last two days. Each record examined will receive one of the following statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto Match:</b> The record has been automatically deduplicated and merged with another record. </li>
            <li><b>Clerical Review:</b> The record is in or has passed through Clerical Review. </li>
            <li><b>Non Match:</b> The record was examined but identified as a unique record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whenever a records data is changed, the deduplication process  will examine the record, causing a large total number of records to display for the Matching Overview. This is not necessarily a need for concern, but rather an indication of general activity.</p>
        <p>The Matching Overview report can be used to give a snapshot of the efficiency of the deduplication routine. This is done by comparing the size of the different slices in the Pie Chart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the 'Non Match' slice is large (relatively speaking), then this indicates that few duplicates have been identified and that Real Time Deduplication  works as it should. Naturally, other factors (e.g., in case of a bulk load of records into the Salesforce instance) may cause the relative number of Non Match records to decrease.</li>
            <li>Comparisons of the 'Auto Match' and 'Clerical Review' slices indicate how many potential duplicates need to go through a manual Clerical Review, as opposed to being automatically matched.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Duplicate Records Auto-matched</h2>
        <p>The Duplicate Records Auto-matched report can be used to look for sudden changes in the number of duplicates that are being created either by users or via bulk import. The line chart reports the number of records that have been identified as duplicates and merged by the automatic deduplication process within the last 11 days. </p>
        <p>If Real Time Deduplication is working as it should, and if its manual entering is the main source for new records, the line should be low and stable.</p>
