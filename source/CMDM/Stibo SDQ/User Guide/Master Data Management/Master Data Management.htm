            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Merging Entries</li>
            <li class="Bullet3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">In the SDQ app, there are two ways for merging entries: Automatic Merge-Simple Merging and Manual Merge-Advance Merging</li>
            <li class="Bullet3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Automatic Merge-Simple Merging is hidden from users. STEP automatically selects the Master record, and usually it is the first record. When merging is complete, the Master record are saved in the SF organization, and other records will be deleted.</li>
            <li class="Bullet3" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Manual Merge-Advance Merging is for the user to make manual merge requests. This way the user can choose what records to be merged, what records to be linked, what information to pull, and which record will be the Master Record. Master record are saved in our SF organization and other records will be deleted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.PRODOC Note">PRODOC note: Per BRJE: From a user perspective there are three: 1. Automatic merge: As described 2. Simple merge - done from the clerical review page: Initiated manually, but triggers the same functions as the Automatic merge 3. Advanced Merge: Accessed from the clerical review page, but else as described. As a side comment: Manual merges can only be completed using Advanced Merge.</p>
