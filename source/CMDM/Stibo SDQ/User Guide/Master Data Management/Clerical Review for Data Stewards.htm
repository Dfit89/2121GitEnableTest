        <h1>Clerical Review for Data Stewards</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Once the MDM theme is configured, Data Stewards can click the Stibo SDQ tab within Salesforce to access Clerical Review functionality, where potential duplicates can be manually reviewed and/or merged if a user determines they are actual duplicates. </p>
        <p class="Body1">The clerical review page offers many features such as Task Assignment and Task Priorities. The purpose of these features is to offer the tools necessary for an organization to design a workflow where multiple people can work together to monitor, assign, prioritize, and complete tasks associated to managing and cleaning up duplicate records.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Within this section the features and functionality pertaining to clerical review for data stewards is described. These option are found on the  Stibo SDQ  Landing Page within the following MASTER&#160;DATA MANAGEMENT menu options: </p>

        <p class="Body1">Once the Master Data Management theme is configured, the Home page will display by default when the Stibo SDQ tab is selected. Also, clicking the Home menu option will display the Home page where clerical review tasks and reports can be accessed. </p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, the Stibo SDQ tab is selected, and the Home page displays. Within the Home page, a clerical review Tasks widget is displayed. The Tasks widget displays currently open clerical review tasks, and filtering options.</p>

        <p class="Body1">Tasks can be filtered to display the following: All, Assigned to me, and Unassigned. Additionally, for each of those filters, tasks can also be filtered by the following priority levels: All, High, Medium, and Low. </p>
        <p class="Body1">As selections are made within the Tasks filters, the count of Clerical Review tasks changes. In the example above, All tasks for All priority levels are selected, and the count of '7' tasks is displayed to the right of the 'Clerical Review' hyperlink.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Once tasks are filtered as desired, and the Clerical Review hyperlink is clicked, the Clerical Review page will display according to the task filters that were applied.</p>
        <h2>Clerical Review</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Clerical Review tasks allow Data Stewards to determine how to handle records flagged as potential duplicates. Records can be flagged as potential duplicates automatically or manually. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Clerical Review tasks are created when STEP identifies potential duplicate data, and clerical review tasks are automatically created within the Stibo SDQ tab. This automation helps users to focus only on conflicts that require manual intervention, automating the rest. For more information on how potential duplicate data is identified, see the <b>Automatic Background Deduplication</b> section<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><MadCap:xref href="../Automatic Background Deduplication.htm" class="HereWithParens"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText> of this guide. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Manually created clerical review tasks occur when a user creates them from the Manual Merge Requests page. For more information, see the <b>Manual Merge Request</b> section below.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Select All: </b>Clicking the Select All checkbox will select all the tasks displayed per the assignment and priority filters, and allow for the merge, reject, link and/or reassignment of selected tasks. This is useful when a Data Steward needs to take the same action for many tasks at one time. For example, if seven tasks are displayed, and the Select All checkbox is enabled, then all seven tasks will display with their respective Select Task checkbox enabled. Also, deselecting the Select All checkbox will disable the individual Select Task checkbox.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="important2" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">If the Select All checkbox is enabled, and a manually created task is included, then the Merge Selected and Reject Selected buttons will not be enabled because manually created tasks must be merged using the Advanced Mode button.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Select Task:</b> Clicking the Select Task checkbox will select the individual task. This is useful when a Data Steward needs to make changes to one or more specific tasks.</li>
            <li><b>Assignment Filters:</b> Each of the Assignment filter buttons (All, Assigned to me, and Unassigned) can be selected to filter the display of tasks by assignment. Automatically created tasks are unassigned by default. Clicking the 'Unassigned' button is useful when a Data Steward needs to focus on automatically created clerical review tasks.</li>
            <li><b>Priority Filters:</b> Each of the Priority filter buttons (All, High, Medium, and Low) can be selected to filter the display of tasks by priority. This is useful when a Data Steward needs to focus on tasks of a certain priority. For example, if many tasks are displayed with different priority levels, and the 'High' priority button is clicked, then only those tasks assigned to the logged in user with a High priority will be displayed. </li>
            <li><b>Priority: </b>Within each task, its priority is listed in the top right corner. When a clerical review task is automatically created, the default priority is 'Medium.' Data Stewards can edit the priority when creating or reassigning clerical review tasks. </li>
            <li><b>Information:</b> Each task has an information icon that when clicked, provides more information for task details. In the example below the information icon is clicked, and the Task Details page displays.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Manually Created Task Warning:</b> When a task has been manually created, a blue warning icon will display. This is important because manually created tasks can only be resolved using the Advanced Mode button. When a user hovers over the blue warning icon, text will display as shown below.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><b>Task Table:</b> The task table displays two or more records identified as potential duplicates. Users can hover over the text within the table to see more details. In the example below, the mouse cursor hovers over part of a mailing address, and the full mailing address is displayed within the hover text.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The Manual Merge Request page allows users to perform a search, add one or more results to a set of potential duplicates, then create another search for other records, and add all or some of the search results to the same set of potential duplicates. This can be repeated, and then the user can save the list, which will create a clerical review task. Users can search for Business Accounts, Person Accounts, or Contacts.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To access the Manual Merge Request page, go to the Stibo SDQ Landing Page and beneath the MASTER&#160;DATA&#160;MANAGEMENT section, click the Manual Merge Requests menu option. The page will display as shown below. </p>

        <p>The 'Search' field can be used to type in  search criteria for Business Accounts, Person Accounts, or Contacts. After typing in the desired search criteria, the user can press the Enter key on their keyboard to start the search. By default, the Business Accounts option is selected. If any duplicates are found, they will display within the Accounts section of the Business Accounts tab. Selecting the Person Accounts tab will display the Person Accounts section, and if any duplicates are found, they will be displayed without having to press the Enter key again. The same is true for selecting the Contacts tab. </p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, 'stibo' has been typed into the Search field, the Enter key has been pressed, and the Business Accounts matching the entry are displayed.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Optionally, the search criteria can be cleared, new search criteria typed into the search field, and the Enter key pressed, resulting in the new search criteria displaying within the Accounts section. Enabling one or more Mark as Duplicate checkboxes, will add records to those already listed in the Duplicate Accounts section. This can be done as many times as necessary to get the desired records to display within the Duplicate Accounts section. </p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example below, 'stibo' text was removed from the Search field, a portion of the phone number was typed in, the Enter key was pressed, resulting in the display of a record in the Accounts section.</p>
