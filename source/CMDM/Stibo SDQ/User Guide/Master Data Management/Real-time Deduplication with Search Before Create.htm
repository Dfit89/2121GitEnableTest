        <h1>Real-time Deduplication with Search Before Create</h1>
        <p class="Body1">With Stibo SDQ's powerful 'Search Before Create Technology,' users have the information they need to eradicate duplicates at the point of entry.  Prior to creating a new record (Business Account, Person Account, and Contact), users are prompted to fill in  relevant information, and a notification for potential duplicates (when applicable) will display for the user. </p>
        <p class="important1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt;">When  searching for duplicate contacts, only contacts within the same account are considered. In other words, if a Billy Button is associated with account 'A,' and a user creates a new contact named Billy Button for account 'B,' then the two Billy Button entries will not be recognized as duplicates because they are assigned to different accounts.</p>
        <p class="Body1">If no potential duplicate is identified for a specific contact and/or account, then the user will be directed to the Contact Edit / Account Edit page where additional data can be entered.</p>
        <p>If one or more potential duplicates are identified for a specific contact / account, then the user will be directed to a Contact Edit (or Account Edit) page with an orange warning indicating: 'We found records that look like potential duplicates. Select an existing record instead?'</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/CMDM/User Guide/SBC Potential Duplicates.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">In the example above potential duplicates have been identified for the contact 'Billy Button,' and the Contact Edit page displays with the orange potential duplicates warning.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Though the example below uses Contacts, the same functionality occurs when Accounts are used.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Once a list of potential duplicates displays, the following options are available for the user:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <b>Back</b> button, returning to the New Contact page without creating a new contact.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Cancel</b> button, returning to the Contacts Recently Viewed without creating a new contact / account.</li>
            <li>Upon review of the potential duplicate list, click on an existing contact record within the NAME column. This will open a different Contact Edit  page, allowing users to view details in order to determine if the contact already exists. On this page, additional information for the contact and/or account can be viewed and/or entered. </li>
            <li> Click the '<b>Create Contact anyway</b>' button, the New Contact Salesforce page will display, and additional information for the new contact can be entered.</li>
        </ul>
