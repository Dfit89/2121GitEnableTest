        <h1>Automatic Background Deduplication</h1>
        <p>Because Stibo SDQ integrates tightly with STEP to continuously monitor the creation of new contacts / accounts in Salesforce (when the MDM theme is applied), Stibo SDQ can be configured to provide both background deduplication, and  clerical review task creation automatically. This allows for multiple processes to occur in the background so that when STEP identifies duplicate data, it can be automatically merged, and when STEP identifies <i>potential</i> duplicate data, then clerical review tasks can be automatically created and displayed within the Stibo SDQ tab. </p>

        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction,Primary.PRODOC Note">Within STEP, the auto threshold setting determines that matches above the configured level will lead to the linking of the record into an entity that contains all Account records that are a match.  From that Entity, a Golden Record can be either persisted or dynamically created in real time based on all attribute values from linked member records based on pre-configured attribute value survivorship rules.  </p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction,Primary.PRODOC Note">Within Stibo SDQ, objects matched above the clerical review threshold but below the auto threshold can be directed to the Clerical Review tasks, which allows Data Steward users to  manually decide within Salesforce if there is an actual match between two records. </p>
        <p class="Body1">Below are the different types of matching scenarios:
 </p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>High-Volume Automatic Matching:</b> Uses an auto-link threshold and calculated match score to reduce the need for manual intervention when a match score is above a certain confidence interval.  This approach naturally requires careful tuning of the matching algorithm.</p>
        <p class="Body2"><b>Clerical Review:</b> Allows all matches above a specified threshold (i.e., a Clerical Review threshold) but below the auto-link threshold to be automatically sent through a clerical review workflow within Salesforce.  This is useful when it is essential to not have false positive matches. For more information, see the <b>Clerical Review for Data Stewards</b> section<MadCap:xref href="Master Data Management/Clerical Review for Data Stewards.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> of this guide.</p>
