        <h1>Source System Performance</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Bobby is a senior data analyst who is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the overall performance and quality of customer data for the many source systems (CRM platforms) within ACME Group subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>To help support the upcoming season, Bobby is assisting the marketing department in streamlining the promotional mailings process and reduce overhead costs.  To do so, Bobby requires the monitoring of address quality ACME Group possesses for their customers, particularly to identify quality within source systems to better identify and address the root problems.</p>
        <p>While an existing data quality policy allows for Bobby to gauge the quality of addresses among the existing data set within ACME Group, should there ever be a change in how data is captured in one of ACME Group’s many source systems, there is not a good way for Bobby to realize this in a timely fashion.  As such, a stream policy which monitors data as they come in from individual source systems would allow Bobby to more easily monitor the behavior/performance of each source system.</p>
        <p>With CMDM, a value metric allows for evaluating of attribute values and mapping to specific scores.  In the scenario of ACME Group’s address quality policy, all customer addresses are verified and standardized via the Loqate integration which returns an Address Quality Index (AQI).  The AQI is a letter score which of the quality of input address that was validated against Loqate’s database.  This letter score is evaluated and resolved as a corresponding numeric score for the policy to profile and display against.</p>
        <p>The following table shows the evaluation of the AQI:</p>

        <p>With this value metric defined, Bobby can configure individual policies to evaluate source system performance of customer addresses.  He is also able to be notified of breaches and view the performance of a particular source system via the policy dashboard:</p>
