        <p>Dylan and Sonya are both data stewards within ACME Group whose team is responsible for analyzing and reporting on organizational governance across the globe.  Dylan is responsible for ACME Healthcare in the US, whereas Sonya is responsible for ACME Inc. in Brazil.</p>
        <p>To assist in planning for an upcoming promotional campaign, ACME Group would like to analyze the current quality of contact information of their customers across the two business units.
