        <h1>Individual Completeness</h1>
        <p>Dylan and Sonya are both data stewards within ACME Group whose team is responsible for analyzing and reporting on organizational governance across the globe.  Dylan is responsible for ACME Healthcare in the US, whereas Sonya is responsible for ACME Inc. in Brazil.</p>
        <p>Having trusted customer data is critical to an organization’s ability to confidently identify who their customers are in driving revenue and strategy.  To achieve this level of maturity, ACME Group would like to obtain an accurate view of completeness of the data they have on their customers based on business unit and country.</p>
        <p>The challenge they face is that there is no way for ACME to have meaningful visibility in assessing the quality of their customer data based even on a small set of core attributes over a period.  The limitations stem from the siloed structure of the various CRM platforms for business units, countries, and subsidiaries operating today.</p>
        <p>ACME Group has chosen to leverage Stibo Systems' CMDM data quality offering to master their customer data.  Typically, performance metrics will vary from country to country due to differences in consumer behavior, culture, standards, regulations, etc.</p>
        <p>To achieve a level of uniformity in performance indicators across business units and countries, it therefore makes sense for Dylan and Sonya to define a common set of attributes which defines a completeness metric from which to gauge customer data.  These core attributes consist of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First name</li>
            <li>Last name</li>
            <li>Address Line</li>
            <li>City</li>
            <li>State/Province</li>
            <li>Postal Code</li>
            <li>Country</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the quality of customer information gathered may vary from country to country, Dylan and Sonya have realized that while the US and Brazil may share the same metrics, there is a need to track the quality of data within each country by using separate policies.  This provides both Dylan and Sonya visibility into how their respective countries are “performing” over time.</p>
        <p>Since ACME is interested in the overall quality of data on their customers, the data quality policy that Dylan and Sonya are responsible for will execute and profile against the existing customer data set as opposed to monitoring incoming data from specific source systems.</p>
        <p>The result is a single completeness metric that is utilized by multiple policies between the US and Brazil (and potentially other countries) with thresholds unique to each country.  As such, Dylan and Sonya can view and edit policy thresholds for their respective countries.  They are also able to view the policy’s performance via the data quality dashboard.  Should a policy breach occur for their respective countries, Dylan and Sonya will be notified via email.</p>
