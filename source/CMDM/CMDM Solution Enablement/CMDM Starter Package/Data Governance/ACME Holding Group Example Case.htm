        <h1>ACME Holding Group Example Case</h1>
        <p>The parent company Acme Group operates across three business units; ACME Healthcare, ACME Inc., and Obits Technologies.  Each business unit spans across multiple countries.</p>
        <p>The three business units operate independently, but have a large overlap in customer base.  It is a company strategy to align the business units in a customer centric way around one central brand that services the customers end-to-end. As part of this journey, customer master data must be aligned between the three business units across the various countries.  For that purpose, ACME Group is turning to Stibo Systems' CMDM solution to help address their needs.</p>
        <p>There is not much overlap in the customer base across countries.  Because of this, information stewardship is divided between each country, as there are many country-specific quirks in the data that local people can more easily deal with.  To facilitate this organizational stewardship, Acme Group has established a governance organization with members from each business unit in each country.  This organization will define a set of local policies for many different things. They expect that the MDM platform can monitor and report on these policies.</p>
        <p>While customer data across various countries may adhere to different standards of completeness, it is widely accepted by ACME that the data being considered while evaluating completeness of a record shall remain the same.  As such, ACME has determined that they require scoring metrics to be agreed upon across the organization.  From there, individual policies may be built on top of the metrics to better define the country-specific thresholds that are appropriate.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, since the focus of each business unit and country may be different, it is not easy for the team to understand what they should monitor.  Therefore, some metrics may not be shared and must be considered as separate metrics for each business unit-country combination.  In other instances, some metrics may be shared, however, the policy thresholds may be different.</p>
