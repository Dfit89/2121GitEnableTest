        <h1>Consolidation and Coexistence Use Case Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body1">ACME Company requires solutions for its Business-to-Customer and its Business-to-Business use cases. </p>
        <h2>ACME Company's Business to Customer Use Case</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The ACME Company is a large clothing brand which markets and sells largely to North America. ACME sells directly to their consumers via various channels. As the company has grown, issues have developed due to poor data quality. Because of this, customer contact information is rarely in sync across business units. Furthermore, all customer shopping patterns are inaccurate because the data is not distributed and updated evenly. This asyncrhonization causes a missed opportunity to target customers for the best sales, promotions, and loyalty programs. Finally, due to these gaps in the data, the customer experience is quite poor as actions performed in one department by a customer are not known in another.</p>
        <p class="Body1">During an internal evaluation of the IT infrastructure, it was revealed that the customer data is owned and maintained by separate and distinct source systems. This setup causes data to not be updated across the enterprise, creating a large amount of conflicting duplicate customer records. Additionally, it was concluded that a lack of data governance has made it impossible to determine what degree of overlap and duplication is present within the customer database.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To improve customer data quality, ACME has targeted a few areas where data quality becomes less consistent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">ACME's e-commerce system processing customers who self-register on the company website.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Customers placing phone orders to a call center representative who then enters their data into ACME's ERP system.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Customers signing up for the loyalty platform.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Marketing uses customer data residing in ACME's CRM system for seasonal marketing campaigns.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">ACME uses loyalty points which can be redeemed for discounts and contain a monetary value. The financial data is owned by the CRM system which stores additional financial information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">North America is the primary market.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">ACME sells directly to customers via various channels.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Multiple different source systems contain customer data.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">The customer data violates ACME's own data policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Difficulties and Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Contact information not in sync across business units.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Customer shopping patterns are of poor quality.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Very poor user experience due to out of sync data across the business units.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">There is an excessive amount of duplicated customer records across the business.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ACME Company's Business to Business Use Case</h2>
        <p class="Body1">ACME Company is a major clothing brand that not only sells directly to individual consumers, but also to both major and independent retailers and distributors across North America. To manage these various retailers, North America is divided up into several sales territories which are each managed by their own sales managers. Each sales territory contains several retailers, and information for each territory is managed by different instances of CRM. Since the same retailers may operate out of various different states or sales territories, ACME Company requires CMDM to not only deduplicate retail entities but also provide a trusted source of information for various source systems.</p>
        <p class="Body1">ACME also tracks and maintains contact persons’ information for each retailer. These contact persons are designated sales representatives, account owners at each retailer, and purchasers in the procurement departments. The CMDM&#160;system must be able to account for contact persons that  move from retailer to retailer, or those that get duplicated within the same organization, to ensure that accurate information  is maintained.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Sales hierarchies are used to organize the customer portfolio in the sales staff and to aggregate bonus schemes in the sales staff, based on the revenue from each customer.</p>
        <h3>Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">ACME sells to both major and independent retailers and distributors as well as to consumers.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">The company mostly services clients in North America.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">The North American region is divided into several sales territories with sales managers responsible for each territory.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Contact persons are maintained in CRM as well as the ERP applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Difficulties and Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">There is an excessive amount of duplicate customer records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">For specific B2B use cases, see the <b>Business-to-Business Coexistence Use Case</b> section of the documentation<MadCap:xref href="../Data Flow/Business-to-Business Coexistence Use Case.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Data Management Improvement Plan</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The ACME Company has strategically planned the evolution of how their customer data will mature over the course of the next few years. To accomplish this long-term goal, an enterprise strategy plan is laid out in three phases, with each phase progressively building on top of the previous one.</p>
        <p>Phase 1 – ACME would like to ensure their customer data is governed and can be trusted across the entire organization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Use MDM technologies to achieve a single, trusted customer view which is accurate, complete, and up to date.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Establish baselines and improve analytical reporting accuracy for a better CRM and e-commerce experience.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Identify customers who live under the same household for more efficient mail distribution and for better profiling of the customer.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Reduce operational overhead cost by decreasing the amount of returned mail due to inaccurate mailing addresses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Phase 2 – ACME would like to combine core customer master data with transactions, website activity and social profiles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Enhance the customer experience by providing a personalized shopping experience.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Utilize purchasing behavior analytics for increasing cross sell / up sell opportunities.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Discover hidden associates and relationships to gather context for segmentation, targeted marketing, risk management, and regulatory reporting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Phase 3 – ACME would like to further enhance the personalized shopping experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Create an enterprise-wide single view of customers to serve all operational systems and use big data to generate insight and foresight based on advanced learning models.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Contextualized customer data is then used to enhance customer experience through machine learning as well as digitally automating key business processes.</li>
        </ul>
