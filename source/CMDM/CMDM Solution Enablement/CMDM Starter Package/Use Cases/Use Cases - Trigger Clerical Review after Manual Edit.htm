        <h1>Use Cases - Trigger Clerical Review after Manually Editing Customer Record</h1>
        <p>Sometimes ACME requires customer records to be manually edited in&#160;STEP to address errors in data quality. In this scenario, STEP identifies a new potential duplicate after the customer record for Kimberley Kaine had the spelling of her first name corrected. Once identified as a potential duplicate, a task is created in a clerical review workflow.</p>
