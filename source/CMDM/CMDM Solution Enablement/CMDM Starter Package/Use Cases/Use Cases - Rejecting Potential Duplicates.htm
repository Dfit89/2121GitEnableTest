        <h1>Use Cases - Rejecting Potential Duplicates</h1>
        <p class="Body1">ACME may want to keep two matched records as separate records under certain circumstances. In such a scenario, a data steward can determine if two or more records in a clerical review workflow should merge or stay as separate entities. As an example, Jonathan Dorthy &amp; Jenkin Doorthy are different people but were flagged as potential duplicates due to their similar names.</p>
        <p>These potential duplicates are displayed via a clerical review task  list in Web UI, where the data steward can  reject the task to keep Jonathan Dorthy &amp; Jenkin Doorthy from merging. Once rejected, the customer records remain as separate records.</p>
