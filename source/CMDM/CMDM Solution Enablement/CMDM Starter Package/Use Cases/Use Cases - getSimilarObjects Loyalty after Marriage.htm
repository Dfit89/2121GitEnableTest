        <h1>Use Cases - getSimilarObjects Preventing Duplicates</h1>
        <p>Catherine Yu signed up in-store for an ACME loyalty account to take advantage of an in-store promotion. Catherine is engaged and living in Texas.  She is across the country from her fiancé who is in Michigan. Catherine signed up for the loyalty program using her maiden name, her Texas address, and her lifelong cell phone number.</p>
        <p>After she's married, Catherine changed her name and moved to Michigan with her new husband. She goes shopping online and forgets she had signed up for the loyalty program and attempts to sign up again.  Catherine uses her new last name, her Michigan address, and her lifelong cell phone number to sign up.</p>
        <p>Without the exact same data, it is impossible for the CRM to find Catherine's loyalty account and previous purchases.</p>
        <p>Catherine creates a duplicate loyalty account.  Flyers and promotions are now being sent to two addresses.  ACME missed cross sell and upsell opportunities because disjointed records make it impossible to identify Catherine's purchase history.</p>

        </p>
        <p>With the current system landscape, Catherine is unable to see that a loyalty account exists under her maiden name.  ACME has a disjointed view of who Catherine is and the products she’s purchased.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The CMDM system can identify Catherine’s existing loyalty account for other systems through the getSimilarObjects call.  Catherine can identify and update her existing loyalty account preventing a duplicate loyalty account from being created.</p>
