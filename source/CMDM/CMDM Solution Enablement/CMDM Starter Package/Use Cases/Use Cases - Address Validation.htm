        <h1>Use Cases - Address Validation</h1>
        <p class="Body1">ACME&#160;requires that address be validated via Loqate whenever a customer record is updated. In this scenario, Jason Kirby has moved to a new address. To account for this change, a data steward navigates to the customer record and manually updates the data. A Loqate request is sent, and new standardized data is returned based on the Jason Kirby's new address.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Typically, this kind of update would come through via a source system, in which case it would have already been validated upon import into STEP. In this scenario, there are no actions required by a data steward.</p>
