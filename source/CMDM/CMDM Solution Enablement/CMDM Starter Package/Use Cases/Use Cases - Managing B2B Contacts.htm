        <h1>Use Cases -  Managing B2B Contacts</h1>
        <p class="Body1">In these use cases, the data steward is responsible for managing  organizational contacts (i.e., for vendors, distributors, etc.).</p>
        <h2>Identifying and Deduplicating Contacts Within the Same Organization</h2>
        <p class="Body1">ACME must ensure that there are no duplicate contact records within the same customer organization. In this scenario, Sergio Bennett and Serge Bennet belong to the same organization and are identified as potential duplicates.</p>
        <p class="Body1">A source system sends a second record for Sergio Bennett with a different source record ID. STEP evaluates the incoming record and determines that it is in fact the same contact person for that specific vendor. Once STEP has determined that Sergio Bennett and Serge Bennet are one and the same, a data steward can merge them into one record via clerical review.</p>
        <h2>Handling Contacts Across Different Organizations</h2>
        <p class="Body1"> Emma Hoffman was previously a contact person for one of their suppliers, but now, works for another one ACME&#160;is associated with.   Since the organizations are different, when the&#160;source system updates STEP with the new organization contact, Emma Hoffman's contact information will not be deduplicated across both organizations.</p>
        <p class="Body1">A new golden record contact for Emma Hoffman is created for that supplier and it is not deduplicated against her previously created golden record.</p>
