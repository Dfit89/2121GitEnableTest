        <h1>Data Flow for Centralized CMDM in B2B Solutions</h1>
        <p>In a centralized implementation methodology, origination and stewardship / maintenance of customer records reside within CMDM.  While many different types of data are often associated with customer records, it is important to note that the role of CMDM is to capture the customer master data that drives operational processes within an organization.   

Within this release, we will focus primarily on centralized methodology for Business-to-Business (B2B) organizations within the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. </p>
        <p class="Body1">

CPG companies manage a wide array of products, brands, categories, and channels, while serving diverse customer segments across multiple geographic regions worldwide. Their end consumers of products are either individual consumers or other businesses such as hospitals, schools, restaurants, etc.  
</p>
        <p class="Body1">
In CPG companies, the majority of revenue is generated by selling through a network of retail chains, distributors, and master wholesalers. These parties are who the CPG company considers its customers.  

Any CPG company has the following operational functions as part of the sales side of their business: 
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales</li>
            <li> 

Distribution</li>
            <li>  

Accounting and finance</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"> 

To meet the needs of such operational functions, CMDM is implemented to enforce and guide the organization in onboarding customers by providing a means to enrich, govern, and maintain their customer data in a centralized manner.</p>

        <h2>Initiate B2B Customer <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2019-07-24T11:22:54.7392893-04:00" MadCap:creator="erpo" MadCap:initials="ER" MadCap:comment="Not sure if these should be just H3 / Bold instead?" MadCap:editor="erpo" MadCap:editDate="2019-07-24T11:23:02.5924532-04:00">Record</MadCap:annotation></h2>
        <p>A new customer record request is initiated within MDM through the Web UI interface.  Initial data provided is  the legal name of the business entity being onboarded.  At this point, two options are provided in the Web UI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find Similar – to ensure no other record with a similar legal name already exists, the user is presented with matching candidates if any are found.</li>
            <li>Save – If no matching candidate is found, the user may save as a new record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For details on Find Similar, see the <b>Find Similar</b> topic in the <b>Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Find Similar.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Create and Initiate in Workflow</h2>
        <p>Once a record is created, it will be automatically initiated into a workflow.</p>
        <h2>Workflow Task and Ad-Hoc Edits</h2>
        <p>By leveraging STEP Workflows, the operational processes such as onboarding, enrichment, and maintenance of master data may be closely owned by various departmental stakeholders across the organization.</p>
        <p>The onboarding workflow allows for detailed enrichment of the new customer record as well as various business conditions to ensure data integrity is upheld.</p>
        <p>Users may be presented with the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save – Edits made to the new record may be saved. It is not uncommon that the save button executes data verification business action(s), such as address verification.</li>
            <li>Submit – Saved edits to a new record may then be submitted to the next state of the workflow.  Data validation may also take place on submission to the next state.</li>
            <li>Delete – User has the option to delete the new record if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see the <b>Workflows in Web UI</b> topic in the <b>Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Workflows in Web UI/Workflows in Web UI.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">All user actions available are dependent upon the user privileges afforded to said user.  It is recommended that privileges are afforded to users based on their role. For example, a logistics specialist cannot delete a record.  Only the MDM Specialist or some other system administrative role can be granted all privileges. For more information, see the Privilege Rules topic in the System Setup / Super User Guide documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../System Setup/Users and Groups/Privilege Rules/Privilege Rules.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>For ad-hoc edits, like edits to an existing record outside of any particular workflow, the user will be presented with the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save – Edits made to the new record may be saved. It is not uncommon that the save button executes data verification business action(s), such as address verification.  Data validation may also take place at this point to ensure data integrity is upheld.</li>
            <li>Request Approval – Approval of changes to the customer record should be the responsibility of the MDM Specialist.  This action will initiate the record into an Approval workflow for the approval.  Further data validations may take place within this workflow to ensure data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon final approval of the customer record, a match event will be generated for the matching event processor to execute matching with the newly created record.</p>
        <h2>Approved Workspace</h2>
        <p>Data promoted to the approved workspace should be considered as having been validated and completed.  Approved customer data may be synchronized to a downstream system to drive external business processes and/or analytics.</p>
        <h2>Matching Event Processor</h2>
        <p>Whenever customer  records are approved, this will trigger a match event.  The event will trigger the match algorithm to execute and compare the new or existing golden record with the entire dataset of customer records.</p>
        <p>Prior to matching, the customer record under treatment will have its match codes updated.  During matching, data within the Approved workspace is to be evaluated.  At this juncture, there are two solution paths that may be taken; the decision of which should be determined using the business requirements gathered by the implementation team.</p>
        <h2>Merge and Auto-Approve Matches</h2>
        <p>In the event that a resulting match score is above the auto-merge threshold, candidates will be merged by the system.  Survivorship rules will update the merged record within the Main workspace and auto-approve the changes to promote to the Approved workspace.</p>
        <p>There may still be a clerical review threshold should it be dictated by the business requirements.</p>
        <h2>Review all Matches</h2>
        <p>All match scores above a certain threshold are considered as potential matches and candidates will be manually reviewed.  Survivorship rules will auto-initiate the potential candidates into an Approval / Clerical Review workflow to be reviewed by an MDM specialist.</p>
        <p>Match scores that fall beneath a certain threshold may be automatically considered as non-matches.</p>
        <h2>Outbound Integration Endpoint</h2>
        <p>Whenever customer  records are approved, an export event will trigger. This allows the mastered data to be synchronized with various downstream systems.</p>
