        <h1>Centralized Use Case Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body1"><span class="bold">CleanGoods Manufacturer</span> is a reputable company in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry.  CleanGoods specializes in the manufacturing and distributing of cleaning supplies, catering to both the average household consumer and professional products lines of business.  As both a manufacturer and distributor of their own products, CleanGoods requires a customer master data management solution to manage the business customers with whom they do business.  The CMDM solution must accommodate and master all operational activities involved in the processes of onboarding new customers as well as maintaining existing ones.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Furthermore, the CMDM solution must also accommodate for the multiple Lines of Businesses (LoBs). In addition to their household cleaning products, they also operate a line of business for profession cleaning supplies and another line of business for backyard barbecue charcoal.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Since multiple departments and roles are actively involved in the onboarding and maintenance processes, the CMDM solution must provide a way to elegantly accommodate each role so they may carry out their tasks, ensuring that customers are uniquely managed via deduplication algorithm(s).  Additionally, the CMDM solution must also execute all operational and regulatory validations on the data to enforce the data integrity of CleanGood’s customer data.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><span class="bold">BlueBox Retailer</span> is a nationally recognized chain of retail stores.  The business model of BlueBox Retailer is to market itself as a one-stop shop for the average consumer to meet all their purchasing needs.  As such, BlueBox carries and sells everything from household goods, furniture, automotive equipment, children’s toys, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and groceries.  Due to the broad range of consumer products carried, BlueBox Retailer works with numerous manufacturers and distributors to negotiate the best purchase price as well as maintaining optimal inventory levels for all regions of their e-commerce and brick-and-mortar locations.</p>
        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Targets North America as its primary market</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Sells through various sales channels: Retailers &amp; Distributors</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Does not currently have a centralized master data repository that supports their existing CRM &amp; ERP platforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, it needs to be noted that sales include multiple lines of business that may target the same customers. For example, brands that specialize in household cleaners, professional cleaners, even recreational consumables such as charcoal for barbecue grills may all target the same retailers and/or distributors.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Logistical operations due to poor master data, such as missed deliveries, inaccurate inventory management, etc.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Business analytics and reporting due to duplicate customer records and inaccurate customer hierarchies across different lines of businesses, like sales reporting and trade promotion planning</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Inefficiency in customer creation processes, leading to poor data quality, delays in deliveries, etc.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Account management challenges, conflicts in term negotiations, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Management Improvement Plan</h2>
        <p class="Body1">CleanGoods has strategically planned the evolution of how their customer data will mature over the course of the next few years. To accomplish this long-term goal, an enterprise strategy plan is laid out in two phases with each phase progressively building on top of the previous one.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><span class="bold">Phase 1</span> – CleanGoods has decided to implement MDM first following a consolidation implementation method. This method allows them to get started on their MDM journey, providing immediate value with the least effort and the least change in business processes and organization. At the same time, CleanGoods can decide with how to best move further on their MDM journey. The objectives are briefly explained below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Use MDM technologies to achieve a single, consolidated customer view which should be as complete and up-to-date as their existing business processes can deliver it, across all lines of business</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Establish baselines and improve analytical reporting accuracy for a better stewardship experience</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Consolidate and build out customer hierarchies across lines of businesses</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Enrich customer master data with third-party data from D&amp;B and other data providers to ease the consolidation of hierarchies and classifications and to identify duplicate records and to improve business analytics</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Improve buyer relationships and efficiency of contract negotiations</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"><span class="bold">Phase 2</span> - CleanGoods would like to ensure their customer data is governed and can be trusted across the entire organization. To accomplish this, CleanGoods has decided to progress their MDM journey following a centralized implementation method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Change and optimize existing business processes for capturing customer master data</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Use MDM technologies to efficiently drive and govern the process of establishing unique, accurate, complete, and up-to-date customer records, and push these records out to operational systems as well as downstream systems such as business analytics.</li>
        </ul>
