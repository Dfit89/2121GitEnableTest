        <h1>Business-to-Customer Coexistence Use Case</h1>
        <h4>Scenario 1 - Marriage</h4>
        <p class="Body1">In this scenario, Catherine Yu lives in Texas and is a customer of ACME who enjoys the experience of discovering the latest clothing trends offered within ACME’s physical (B&amp;M) stores.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Catherine occasionally shops on ACME’s e-commerce site due to the online exclusive promotions and friendly in-store return policy. Having recently gotten engaged, Catherine signed up for ACME’s customer loyalty program so she can take advantage of additional loyalty perks and savings in order to save for the wedding and honeymoon.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Sandra manages Catherine’s order from a B2C e-commerce site which contains no address validation, allows multiple accounts to be created for a single customer, and lacks any form of de-duplication of customer records. Lacking address validation leads to missed order deliveries which damages brand reputation. Allowing multiple customer accounts of a single record due to no deduplication leads to loss of cross sell opportunities as an email or sales catalog may be sent based off the information of an old account. Deduplicating and consolidating these records allow all contact information to be available on a single entity, eliminating errors caused by multiple conflicting entities</p>
        <p class="Body1">Charles Johnson, Catherine’s fiancé, is from Michigan and is an occasional shopper of ACME brand clothing.  As a loyalty program member, Charles has decided to take advantage of recent promotions in preparation for their wedding. Upon marriage, Catherine has chosen to take Charles’ last name and moved to Michigan with Charles.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Customer data gathered in physical stores are managed by a CRM platform which associates credit card payments to specific customers to ensure faster processing and confirmation or receipt delivery, while customer data gathered from the e-commerce site is managed by an e-commerce system. Customer loyalty sign-ups are tracked by a different CRM platform that is owned and maintained by the marketing department.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Because ACME’s multiple CRM and SAP systems are siloed and are not synched with one another there is no automated capability for ACME to identify that Catherine Yu and Catherine Johnson are the same customer.  ACME also does not have a straightforward way to identify customers who have relocated to a different address.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Furthermore, ACME would like to be able to identify customer groupings as households in order to minimize wasted marketing mailings and to better target buyer behaviors.</p>
        <p class="Body1">As these challenges are currently not addressed, several problems arise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">For every seasonal marketing campaign, mailings that are sent to Catherine end up at her old address in Texas which causes her to miss out on certain promotions and even important rebate checks.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Charles gets some of the same marketing mailings but since he’s not a big shopper, he ends up throwing them out before Catherine sees them.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Even after Catherine had to call into the ACME call center to update her address, ACME still sent double of every marketing mailing to Catherine and Charles even though they live together which adds to the frustration in Charles’ and Catherine’s customer experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Current Data Flow</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/Data Flow/Use Case 4b.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The e-commerce system is unable to identify that Catherine Yu and Catherine Johnson are the same customer. This leads to three separate records being created. No connection between Catherine and Charles has been identified.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>To-Be Data Flow</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/Data Flow/Use Case 4c.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The CMDM system can identify that Catherine Yu is the same customer as Catherine Johnson and will merge them into a single golden record. Additionally, CMDM will be able to identify the Johnson Household based on a shared last name and address. The household concept allows marketing to avoid redundant mailings and better target offers and promotions.</p>
        <h4>Scenario 2 - E-Commerce</h4>
        <p class="Body1">Sandra is responsible for managing orders coming from the new B2C e-commerce site, as well as returns. She succeeds when she can deliver the right product to the right customer at the right time.</p>
        <p class="Body1">ACME Company’s goal is to make it as easy as possible for customers to buy their products. If customers do not remember their log in, they can  create a new user and then place the order, or even place smaller orders without creating a user. Customers must also provide their delivery address.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Poor data quality has created several challenges for ACME Company, preventing them from achieving their goal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Addresses are not validated before the order is sent to logistics, leading to a lot of products delivered to wrong addresses or not arriving to the right customer at the right time.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Sometimes customers accidentally misspells their address or leave out vital information.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Duplicates are and will continue to be created in the e-commerce and ERP systems.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Neither the e-commerce system or ERP can check for duplicates, obfuscating how much a customer actually buys from ACME.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Customers do not receive their orders in a timely manner (or at all).</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Inconsistent customer experience, as duplicate accounts may lead to orders not being associated between duplicates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">These issues result in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Low data quality of delivery locations leads to instances of 'return to sender' and double shippings, causing increased costs.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Poor customer experience due to orders not arriving in a timely manner.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Lost revenue and loss of customers. If the products are not delivered in a timely manner, customers will buy products from elsewhere.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Increased returns.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Duplicate records carry operational and analytical consequences. Operationally, the correct delivery address may be available on a duplicate record. This leads to customer frustration if ACME is not considering that record when shipping. Analytically, reports may be skewed as duplicate records cause a single customer to be weighed multiple times during analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Current Data Flow</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/Data Flow/Use Case 5a.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">The customer places orders that are processed out of an e-commerce system. The customer and order details are sent to the ERP system for processing and to get shipments out. Currently, there are no validations being done on the provided address. This causes customers to not receive their purchases in a timely manner or not at all. Additionally, shipments may be returned to sender causing increased costs.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>To-Be Data Flow</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Image1">

        </p>
        <p>The CMDM solution is integrated with Loqate to verify and standardize addresses. This increases address quality, reducing instances of 'return to sender' and deliveries shipped to the wrong address. Using Loqate as a webservice, the addresses can be standardized at the point of entry in the Ecommerce system. Additionally, an Ecomm administrator can manage customer accounts and have addresses standardized without directly interacting with STEP.</p>
