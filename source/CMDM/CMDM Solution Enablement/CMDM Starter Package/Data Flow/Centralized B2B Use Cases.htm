        <h1>Centralized B2B Use Cases</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Below we can see actual challenges and solutions in place for several use cases.</p>
        <h2>Scenario 1: Direct Customer Onboarding</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Philip</span>, a Category Manager at BlueBox Retailer, serves as the primary contact for the company’s manufacturers and suppliers with a focus on the household cleaning supplies product line.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Lance</span>, a Sales Representative for CleanGoods, has the responsibility of validating the legitimacy of BlueBox Retailer as a prospective customer that CleanGoods Manufacturer wishes to do business with.  This may involve validating against third-party syndicated data analytic companies (i.e., Nielsen TDLinx or IRI) which provide insight on the prospect’s business operations, retail sales data, corporate structures, and information on individual retail locations.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Kathy</span>, a Controller from the Finance team, runs validations of the prospective customer including a credit check, which may also contain usage of third-party data providers (i.e., Dun &amp; Bradstreet).  Such validations enable CleanGoods Manufacturer in identifying any type of fraudulent activity.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">George</span>, a Logistics Specialist, is responsible for determining how to fulfill the order. This involves evaluating a number of factors such as projected order frequency, product assortment, volume, stock, package type, geography, etc. to determine how the customer is to receive the products.</p>
        <p>The role of the <span class="bold">MDM Specialist</span> serves as the primary owner of the CMDM system and approves all changes submitted by the various departments during the onboarding process.</p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>BlueBox Retailer has begun negotiations to procure and resell products from two CleanGoods lines of business.  BlueBox is especially interested in <span class="bold">CleanGoods'</span> line of household cleaning products as well as their charcoal line of business.</p>
        <p>Philip has been negotiating with Lance, the sales representative from CleanGoods, in finalizing initial sales terms for their household products line of business. Once finalized, Lance will initiate the new customer request to begin the CMDM onboarding / enrichment process.</p>
        <p>Part of Lance’s responsibility during the onboarding process is to validate the legitimacy of the customer as a legal business entity.   Such validations may occur outside of the operational MDM.  If the results of the customer validations are favorable, Lance will continue working with Philip to classify / enrich the new customer record with relevant information.  Such information that Lance requires includes (not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Trade Channel - How do products reach the end-consumer (i.e., In-store retail, e-commerce, mail order, warehouse stores, etc)?</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Product Lines - What types of products will Bluebox Retailer be purchasing?</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Line of Business - What particular line(s) of business will BlueBox be conducting transactions with?</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Location Setup</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">All <i>Ship To's</i></li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Location information for each physical location CleanGoods Manufacturer must deliver products to (e.g., warehouses, distribution centers, retail stores, etc.).</li>
            <li class="Bullet3">All <i>Sell To's</i></li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Location information for each Sell-To location CleanGoods Manufacturer must send invoices to (e.g., Corporate head office, regional offices, accounts receivable department, etc.).</li>
            <li class="Bullet4">Financial / accounting information for each Sell-To location, used for invoicing purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It may be required that additional processes are kicked off in various operational systems external to the MDM in order to add additional information in those systems which do not belong in the MDM system, for example, it could be that certain data is local to one process and / or it is most convenient that the data be maintained in the operational systems.</p>
        <p>As part of the onboarding process, Kathy from the Finance department must ensure finance-related enrichment activities take place.  These activities include conducting credit checks of the customer for any financing approval by leveraging third-party services such as a Dun &amp; Bradstreet company profile.  Additionally, Kathy may work with Lance during initial negotiations to provide pricing and trade promotion of products sold to BlueBox.  Pricing usually originates and is maintained within an ERP system.</p>
        <p>Once the customer sales &amp; financial enrichment process is complete, George from the Logistics department must determine if the customer requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Ship to Store</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Ship to Customer Distribution Center</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Direct Pick-up at the Manufacturer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Considerations must be given to storage requirements as well as any regulatory requirements or hazardous material protocols.  For example, some products may only be stored in specific warehouses equipped with refrigeration or hazardous products may require special shipping and handling instructions.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The current operational landscape of CleanGoods is rather siloed and does not provide a means to onboard and enrich customer data in a centralized way.  Due to this, operational data is scattered across disparate systems with facilitation or governance in place.  Each role may enact their individual governance to manage data integrity with little to no consciousness of impact to other departments or overall operations.</p>
        <p>Currently, Lance must work with the customer to finalize sales terms and other commercial considerations, he must then work internally with a specialist to initiate a new customer request.  Kathy from Finance is then notified via email of the new customer request and must then work out of ERP to determine exact pricing, and update the financial portfolio.  Should Kathy have any questions for Lance, she must likewise correspond with him over email or a phone call.  Furthermore, the same process is followed to notify George from Logistics so he may address delivery and warehousing considerations.</p>
        <p>Without a centralized ownership of the onboarding process and governance in place to ensure validations and regulatory requirements are adhered to, CleanGoods finds that their data is prone to error, often duplicated, and leads to unreliable business analytics, regulatory fines and damage to brand reputation.</p>
        <p>The current data flow is illustrated below:</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/SystemSetup/Centralized Cases 1.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>With a CMDM solution in place, the responsibilities and activities of new customer onboarding and enrichment will be facilitated in a centralized fashion with all the necessary data integrity and governance in place for a more seamless experience.  This ensures operational efficiency within the new customer onboarding process by leveraging the capture and enrichment of the right data by the right people at the right point in time.</p>
        <p>Lance will now initiate new customer requests directly within MDM which runs a <i>Find Similar</i> algorithm to proactively ensure uniqueness and eliminates the risk of introducing duplicate or redundant customer records.</p>
        <p>Lance will enter the terms of sale and all associated information onto the new customer request, at which point Lance will transfer the onboarding task (within MDM) to Kathy in Finance for further enrichment. Kathy will then see the new task within her task list which informs her that she needs to enrich the same record Lance initiated.</p>
        <p>Once the task is assigned to Logistics, George can find all the information in MDM. This allows him to quickly turn around and establish a plan to meet the new order requirements. Once logistical information has been entered a final review is performed by the MDM specialist and the new customer may be considered as an active customer of CleanGoods.</p>

        <h2>Scenario 2: Onboarding New Retail Store Locations</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Same characters as in Scenario 1: Philip, Lance, Kathy, and George.</p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">BlueBox Retailer</span> is seeking to strategically expand their footprint in the Southeast region of the United States.  In order to beat their competitors to new markets, executive management has devised plans to open 12 new BlueBox Retailer locations in suburban neighborhoods of multiple major metropolitan areas in the Southeast.</p>
        <p>The impact of new store locations is that all product line purchase orders must be amended or supplemented to meet the demand of an entirely new geographical region.  To meet this demand, <span class="bold">Philip</span> has reached out to CleanGoods Manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Philip works with <span class="bold">Lance</span>, a Sales Support Specialist, to provide the necessary information. Since BlueBox Retailer is a realized customer, Lance does not need to initiate an onboarding process, but rather update the existing customer. To do so Lance must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Obtain the physical address of all 12 locations in order to create the relevant Ship-To’s and Sell-To’s.</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Obtain information on what specific product lines the new stores will carry</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Obtain any additional information specific to these new locations (Geographical, new product line availability, order frequency, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Kathy</span> from Finance will work with Lance reviewing sales terms for the new locations.  While new locations may have little to no impact to terms of sale, it is Kathy’s responsibility to ensure both parties are in agreement of the negotiated terms.  It is up to CleanGoods’ discretion whether they would provide special allowances to assist in promoting the BlueBox new store location.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">George</span> from Logistics must determine how to fulfill the order. This involves evaluating several factors such as projected order frequency, product assortment, volume, stock, package type, geography, etc.  Since BlueBox Retailer requires that all products be shipped directly to their stores, George will leverage the new Ship-To’s to plan out routes and scheduling.</p>
        <p>The challenges faced by CleanGoods are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Lack of standardized collaboration mechanism between roles / departments; everything is transacted over email and/or in person notifications</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Lack of traceability of changes to data over time which leads to challenges during investigation and accountability</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Challenges to data governance leads to poor regulatory adherence and decrease in brand reputation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>The current data flow of adding new stores and corresponding Bill-to and Ship-to locations does not provide a dynamic for the various teams to easily collaborate. Currently, Lance must email the MDM Specialist to notify of upcoming changes to an existing customer, BlueBox.  The MDM Specialist must then update the customer record in ERP and notify Kathy to evaluate the financial impacts.  Should Kathy have any questions for Lance regarding the request, she must contact him separately.  Lastly, George must also be notified so he may consider the logistical impact of multiple new Ship-to locations.</p>
        <p>Without a centralized ownership of the maintenance process and governance in place to ensure validations and regulatory requirements are adhered to, CleanGoods often finds that their data is prone to error, duplicated, and leads to unreliable business analytics, regulatory fines, and damage to brand reputation.</p>
        <p>The current data flow is illustrated below:</p>
        <p class="Body1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/SystemSetup/Centralized cases 3.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>With a CMDM system in place, the various departmental responsibilities of updating an existing customer record is now within a centrally governed and collaborative solution.</p>
        <p>Lance will now be able to edit the existing BlueBox customer record by adding the necessary location information as well as relevant sales attribution.  Lance may then assign a task to Kathy within the application.</p>
        <p>Kathy will review and reference the updated information to enable her to finalize any changes necessary to sales terms and related pricing.</p>
        <p>Once the task is assigned to Logistics, George is now able to see the updated Ship-To locations which allows him to quickly turn around and establish a plan to meet the new order requirements.</p>
        <p>The future state data flow is illustrated below:</p>

        <h2>Scenario 3: Existing Customer in Additional Line of Business</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Same characters as in Scenario 1: Philip, Lance, Kathy, and George.</p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>BlueBox Retailer is seeking to expand their in-store selection of household, consumer-grade charcoal to take advantage of the upcoming BBQ season.  To do so, BlueBox has initiated sales negotiations with CleanGoods’ charcoal line of business under the sub-brand, CleanCoal.  Although BlueBox is an existing customer, onboarding a new line of business requires a similar governing process as  onboarding a new customer.</p>
        <p>Alexander works with Lance to initiate sales negotiations for CleanCoal's line of business.  Since there is no need to validate BlueBox as a legitimate business entity, Lance must determine and update the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Trade Channel - How products reach the end-consumer (i.e., In-store retail, e-commerce, mail order, warehouse stores, etc).</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Product Lines - What types of products will Bluebox Retailer be purchasing?</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Location Set-up - Determine whether existing Ship-To and Sell-To locations are sufficient or if new locations are required to be set up for the new product line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of the process, Kathy from the Finance department must ensure finance-related enrichment activities takes place.  This may include working with Lance during sales negotiations to provide pricing and trade promotion of products sold to BlueBox that is specific to the CleanCoal line of business.  Pricing usually originates and is maintained within an ERP system.</p>
        <p>Once the customer sales &amp; financial enrichment process is complete, George from the Logistics department must determine if the customer requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Ship to Store</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Ship to Customer Distribution Center</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Direct pick-up at the manufacturer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Considerations must be given to storage requirements as well as any regulatory requirements or hazardous material protocols for transporting and storing charcoal.</p>
