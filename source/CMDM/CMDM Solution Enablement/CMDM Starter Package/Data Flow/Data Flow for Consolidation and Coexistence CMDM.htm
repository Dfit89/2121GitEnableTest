        <h1>Data Flow for Consolidation and Coexistence CMDM</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Having customer data authored and stored across separate source systems creates a barrier for achieving a unified and trusted view of customer data. When data has multiple sources, it can become inconsistent, inaccurate, outdated, and cause conflicts.</p>
        <p class="Body1">ACME Company has multiple source systems from which customer data originates. The flow of customer data for ACME Company begins at these points of entry, each of which is associated with a variety of channels. These channels include: the company website, phone direct, in-store, etc. (see Figure 1 below). ACME contains three source systems (Figure 2):</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">E-commerce system for customers who place their orders and self-registers via the company’s website.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">ERP system for customers who place orders by phone via ACME Company’s call center.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">CRM system for driving seasonal marketing campaigns and financial data, which drives in-house financing as well as managing customer loyalty programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">To understand how data flows into STEP and between applications, refer to the two implementation methodologies: consolidation and coexistence. For information on how the different implementation methodologies function, see the <b>Customer Master Data Management Overview</b> section of this documentation<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><MadCap:xref href="../../Customer Master Data Management Overview.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Data enters into STEP through external channels where customers will provide their information. In section 1 of the image below, these channels may be through a telephone order, a web order, when they sign up for a loyalty platform, or when they buy in-store.</p>
        <p class="Body1">After their data is recorded, it is saved to various source systems. A source system is any system that stores data to be delivered to the CMDM solution. In this use case, the source systems are the CRM, ERP, and E-commerce platforms (Figure 2). Once the data is inside of the CMDM application, data is standardized, matched with existing records, and golden records are created / maintained. Data will then be stored in a datastore / data warehouse.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more details on what happens in Figure 3, see the Application path image following this section. Also, see the <b>Matching</b> topic <MadCap:xref href="../Configurations/Matching.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> and the <b>Loqate</b> topic <MadCap:xref href="../Data Integration/Address Validation.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> of this documentation for more information. </p>
        <p class="Body1">In a coexistence implementation, the data matched and merged in the CMDM solution (Figure 3) will be updated back at the source systems (Figure 2) as well as downstream solutions (Figure 4).</p>
