        <h1>Data Stewardship</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Data stewardship in a CMDM application is performed by two distinct roles: data stewards and business users. Each role requires the configuration of different Web UI screens to perform certain tasks. In this topic, these two roles (and the tasks performed by each) will be defined. Web UI configuration guidelines will also be provided.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When configuring any Web UI, consult the Web UI documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Web UI Getting Started/Web User Interfaces.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. This documentation contains details on how to add various components of the Web UI.</p>
        <h2>Role of the Data Stewards</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Experienced data stewards must be provided with the proper tools to ensure data quality.</p>
        <p class="Body1">These tasks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">Clerical Review - Data Stewards can review potential duplicates.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Manually maintaining records - Data Stewards update and edit records as needed.</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Monitoring / Data Quality - Data Stewards should review customer data quality in the Web UI, and monitor Source system performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Steward Tasks</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Typically, Data Stewards will need to perform the following tasks: clerical review, ad-hoc data stewardship, data governance, hierarchy maintenance, and attribute maintenance.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The online help topics for these tasks are extensive and cover configuration and typical use.</p>
        <h3>Clerical Review</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Clerical reviews allow a data steward to approve matched duplicates, reject erroneously matched records, and reassign tasks that are better suited for other users.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To assist data stewards in identifying critical issues, Clerical Review task lists can be filtered to display only high priority tasks. To flag tasks as high priority, a workflow status flag and accompanying business condition must be configured on the relevant matching algorithm.</p>

            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/High Priority Filter.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information on clerical reviews, see the <b>Golden Record Clerical Review Task List</b> topic in the <b>Using a Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Golden Record Clerical Review Task List.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Use Cases</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur is a senior data steward responsible for the carrying out several data management tasks, and must interact with many areas of the Web UI to do so.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When Arthur begins his day, he will first handle any clerical review tasks that may have been generated from the previous day’s activity. Some new customers coming into CMDM have a risk flag set to ‘yes’, this requires Arthur’s immediate attention. Arthur is made aware of these high priority tasks through a visual cue (see below). Arthur is then able to enter the task list and filter based on priority. This allows Arthur to immediately address the high priority clerical reviews, before continuing with his other tasks.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Components</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur utilizes the following components to address the story presented above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">The Primary Navigation Panel - Allows Arthur to see all clerical review tasks grouped in one central location. For more information, see the <b>Primary Navigation Panel Component</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Main Properties/Primary Navigation Panel Component.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Golden Record Clerical Review Task List – Allows Arthur to address deduplication tasks. More specifically, this screen allows for merging duplicate records, task reassignment, and rejecting potential duplicates.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Advanced Merge – Allows Arthur to manually dictate survivorship by selecting individual attribute values.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Data stewardship requires users to deal with voluminous amounts of data. To make it easy to manage this data quickly, collections are used. Collections are created by performing an advanced search then saving the results. These collections can be used to perform bulk updates as well as access all these records at will.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">For information on collections and how to create queries for searching, see the <b>Using Advanced Search</b> topic in the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/AdvancedSearch/Using Advanced Search.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>. To use the collections with ad-hoc bulk updates, see the <b>Bulk Update Operations</b> topic of the <b>Bulk Update</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Bulk Updates/Creating a Bulk Update/Bulk Update Operations.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"><b>Use Cases</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Arthur has been tasked with identifying all customers who live in Florida so they can create a new campaign to market ACME’s new swimwear. Utilizing an advanced search, Arthur can identify these customers and save them as a collection. Arthur can then export this collection and send it to the appropriate marketing specialists.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Arthur has been asked to investigate customer email quality to ensure a successful marketing campaign. Arthur realizes that no validations have been run to verify email addresses. Utilizing a bulk process, Arthur can have all customer emails validated (i.e., Experian). This allows marketing to avoid sending emails to customers with invalid email addresses. These customers can then be sent a physical letter with the promotion.</p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction"><b>Components</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Arthur utilizes the following components to address the story above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Advanced Search Screen - A link from the homepage takes Arthur to an advanced search screen, allowing him to customize a search based on a variety of options. Collections can be saved once a search is made. For more information, see the <b>Advanced Search</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/AdvancedSearch/Advanced Search.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Image2" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/AdvancedSearchConfig.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li class="Numbered1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Node Details Screen – Once a collection is saved it can be accessed and viewed via a node details screen.  Manual edits of the customer data may also be made from this screen. For more information, see the <b>Node Details Screen</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Node Details/Node Details Screen.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Export – Data exports may be made on search results for reporting purposes.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Bulk Updates – Bulk updates may be executed on a collection for mass editing.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Collection Content – Sub screen used to display a list of records in a collection.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Under Construction">Source Record Traceability – Sub screen that allows Arthur to see which source system individual attribute values were retrieved from. For more information, see the <b>Golden Record Source Traceability Screen</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Golden Record Source Traceability Screen.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hierarchy Maintenance</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Maintaining the company hierarchy is key to ensuring that data can be correctly represented across the enterprise. Using a hierarchy visualization implementation helps represent the flow of companies and how their ownership functions.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information on setting up and using a company hierarchy, see the <b>Company Hierarchy Visualization and Maintenance</b> topic of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Data Visualization/Company Hierarchy Visualization and Maintenance.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Use Cases</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">A volcanic eruption has destroyed an ACME subsidiary. Arthur has been asked to remove the subsidiary from ACME’s corporate hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur navigates the subsidiary in question and selects the hierarchy tab. From this screen, Arthur can remove the link to its parental organization using built in functions.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Components</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur utilizes the following components to address the story above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Global Search – Arthur is able to navigate to the subsidiary based on source record ID.</li>
            <li>Company Data Hierarchy Screen – This screen allows Arthur to add, edit, and remove links throughout the hierarchy. Several different views are also available for each hierarchy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Attribute Maintenance</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Data stewards must create and maintain various attributes and attribute groups.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information on attributes, see the <b>Attribute and LOV Creation and Maintenance  in Web UI</b> topic of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Attributes and LOVs/Attribute and LOV Creation and Maintenance in Web UI.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Use Cases</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur has been notified by management that an upstream SAP system is now tracking additional financial attributes (Income Verified Flag). Arthur would like to create this attribute in CMDM, so he will have access to the most complete view of the customers.</p>
        <p class="Body1">To do so, Arthur will utilize the attribute maintenance screens. First, Arthur will need to identify the correct party data attribute group. Since this is new financial data, Arthur decides it belongs best in the IncomeData group. Arthur selects this group and can create the attribute using the buttons on the screen.</p>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Components</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Arthur utilizes the following components to address the story above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="Numbered1">Attribute Group Management Screen – Using this screen, Arthur can view all attributes within the attribute group and judge whether the new attribute he wants to create belongs there. For more information, see the <b>Attribute Group&#160;Management Screen</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Attributes and LOVs/Attribute Group Management Screen.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Attribute Link Editor Screen -  Arthur can establish or remove links between attributes via this screen. For more information, see the <b>Attribute Link Editor Screen</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Attribute Link Editor/Attribute Link Editor Screen.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li class="Numbered1">Attribute Management Screen – Arthur can create new attributes or edit existing ones via the Attribute Management Screen. He can edit the attribute details, change the attribute validity, and maintain attribute links via various tabs configurable on this screen. For more information, see the <b>Attribute&#160;Management Screen</b> section of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Attributes and LOVs/Attribute Management Screen.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body1"><b>Additional Considerations when Performing Attribute Maintenance</b>
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Import configurations will need to be updated with the appropriate mappings. Otherwise the new incoming data will not be written to any attribute.</p>
        <p class="Body1">If the attribute does not fit into any existing attribute groups, a new group should be created first. If the attribute fits into a current display group, no Web UI configuration is needed. If it is a standalone attribute, it will need to be manually added to the appropriate details screens.</p>
        <p class="Body1">If the attribute should be considered during matching, the algorithms and/or match codes will need to be adjusted. If the intention is for the attribute to ‘pool’ similar customers together, it should be added as a match code function. If the attribute is intended to be considered by the algorithm, a new corresponding normalizer and matcher must be added. Additionally, the rules must be updated to include how the final score provided by the algorithm is affected. In order for survivorship to properly execute, the attribute must be placed in the relevant survivorship groups.</p>
        <p class="Body1">An onboarding process may be considered to verify that all considerations have been accounted for prior to finalizing new attribute(s).</p>
        <p class="Body1">If the attribute should be monitored via data governance, required policies and widgets will need to be updated to account for it.</p>
        <h2>Role of Business User</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Experienced business users need to be able to accurately search for customers to verify information, and export customer data.</p>
        <h3>Business User Tasks</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Business users need to be able to maintain small areas of the database, mostly involving searching for customers to find records and exporting this data.</p>
        <h3>Advanced Search and Data Export</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Business users need to be able to navigate the large amount of data in the system. To do this, they need to create customized, granular searches using a myriad of search criteria.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Nikki, a business user, has been asked to export a list of customers who  have outstanding payments. To do so, Nikki utilizes an advanced search. Nikki then saves the results to a collection and uses the built-in buttons to export.</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/PastDueDollars.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">To build these search queries, see the <b>Using Advanced Search</b> topic in the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/AdvancedSearch/Using Advanced Search.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Once the data is isolated for external support, the data will need to be exported. For more information, see the <b>Export Manager</b> topic of the <b>Data Exchange</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Data Exchange/Export Manager/Export Manager.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Manual Edits</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Business users may also manually edit customer information within the Web UI.  One example is a business user working within a call center may receive an updated contact number from a customer.  The business user may edit an existing phone number or add an additional number to the customer’s record.</p>
        <p class="Body1">While working in a call center, Nikki receives a phone call from a customer. The customer has notified Nikki that they are moving and would like to update their address to continue receiving promotional mailings. Nikki is able to look this customer up based on a provided loyalty card number and manually update the address. Once Nikki saves the address update, Loqate will trigger and standardize the new address.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Manual edits within the Web UI is generally carried out within the Node Details Screen.</p>
        <h3>Hierarchy Maintenance</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Business users may also be responsible for maintaining company hierarchies.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Maintaining the company hierarchy is key to ensuring that data can be correctly represented across the enterprise. Using a hierarchy visualization implementation helps represent the flow of companies and how their ownership functions.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information on setting up and using a company hierarchy, see the <b>Company Hierarchy Visualization and Maintenance</b> topic of the <b>Web UI</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../Web User Interfaces/Using Web UI/Data Visualization/Company Hierarchy Visualization and Maintenance.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
