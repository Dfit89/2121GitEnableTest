        <h1>Algorithm &amp;&#160;Match Codes - Organizational Customer</h1>
        <h2 class="RNNoTOC">Matching Algorithm</h2>
        <p class="Body1">The Organization Matching Algorithm delivered as part of the initial configuration is designed as a match algorithm for Organization Customer solutions.  This algorithm is most relevant in a Business to Business (B2B) style implementation and consists of two normalizers and two matchers, with an Auto Threshold of 90.0 and a Clerical Review Threshold of 60.0.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information on configuring a Matching Algorithm, see the <b>Configuring Matching Algorithms</b> section of the <b>Matching, Linking, and Merging</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Matching, Linking, and Merging/Configuring Matching Algorithms.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Normalizers</p>
        <p class="Body1">Normalizers are used to standardize values that are being compared. This ensures equal formatting is applied, increasing the accuracy of the comparisons being made.  For more information, see the <b>Decision Table Normalizers</b> section of the <b>Matching, Linking, and Merging</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Matching, Linking, and Merging/Decision Table Normalizers.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Organization Name Normalizer</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Organization Name Normalizer for the Organization Algorithm is configured to normalize only the Legal Name (LegalName) attribute for organization entities.</p>
        <p class="Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Address Normalizer</p>
        <p class="Body1">Because it is recommended to model addresses as data containers, the Address Normalizer will need to be configured to normalize data container attributes as defined within the Address component model.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Matchers</p>
        <p class="Body1">For general information on configuring Matchers, see the <b>Decision Table Matchers</b> section of the <b>Matching, Linking, and Merging</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Matching, Linking, and Merging/Decision Table Matchers.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Organization&#160;Name Matcher</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Organization Name Matcher is used by the algorithm to match on organization names. This matcher is left with default settings, however it is recommended that the Organization Name Matcher is tuned to the specifics of the organization. </p>
        <p class="Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Address Matcher</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Address Matcher utilizes default configuration values.</p>
        <p class="Body1">When matching organizations, keep in mind that multiple business entities may reside at a singular address. For example, Office Buildings where no suite number is provided.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Rules</p>
        <p class="Body1">When considering match rules, the recommended strategy is to dissect the customer’s information into the smallest possible portions of data.  These rules should not weigh the sum of <i>all</i> the customer’s input data (which is likely inefficient), and requires a careful analysis of the customer dataset in order to determine what combinations of attributes present the best chance of uniqueness.</p>
        <p class="Body1">There is only one Rule associated with the Organization Algorithm.&#160;This Rule evaluates the scores of the Name and Address matchers.  The resulting score is then weighed against the defined algorithm thresholds to determine whether the organization record should be created, auto-merged, or if it requires a clerical review.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> Common attributes to match for organizations on include Address, DUNS (D&amp;B Number), and Tax Identifier. </p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Survivorship</p>
        <p class="Body1">The following survivorship rules are used by the Organization Algorithm:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Value:&#160;Most Recent</b>
                <ul>
                    <li class="Bullet2"><b>Attribute / Attribute Group:</b>&#160;Organizations - Most Recent</li>
                    <li class="Bullet2"><b>Last Edit Date Attribute:</b>&#160;Last Edit Date - Record</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="Bullet2"><b>Data Container:&#160;Most Recent</b>
                <ul>
                    <li class="Bullet2"><b>Business Condition:</b> DataContainer Survivorship Address</li>
                    <li class="Bullet2"><b>Data Container Type:</b> Main Address</li>
                    <li class="Bullet2"><b>Last&#160;Edit Date Attribute:</b> Last Edit Date - Main Address</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Data Containers require their own survivorship rules. Additionally, each Survivorship rule requires a unique Last&#160;Edit Date attribute.</p>
        <h2 class="RNNoTOC">Match Codes</h2>
        <p class="Body1">For the Organization Customer entity type, three separate Match Codes are being generated.  While based on the demographics of the organization record, these Match Codes are composed of the Email, Phone Number, and a combination of Legal Name and Address.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Since initial demographic data for organizations may be limited prior to enrichment (for example, Dun &amp; Bradstreet detailed profile), generating these three Match Codes will help ensure proper identification of organizations during the match process.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For information on how to configure Match Codes in STEP, see the <b>Configuring Match Codes</b> section of the <b>Matching, Linking, and Merging</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Matching, Linking, and Merging/Configuring Match Codes.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Email Match Code</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Email Match Code is  the normalized value of the organization’s main contact email address.  Both the username (or local part) of the email and the domain are normalized to ensure variations of the same email address (as a result of differing cases or special characters) are accounted for.</p>
        <p class="Body1">It is recommended to add a discernible prefix to each Match Code so the end-user may easily identify what attribute(s) the Match Code is based off of.  The Email Match Code contains the prefix 'EM~'.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Phone Number Match Code</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Phone Number Match Code is the normalized value of the organization’s main contact phone number.  The normalization removes any parenthesis and hyphenation in between numbers.  Additionally, the area itself has been removed, leaving only the last 7 digits available as the Match Code.  Phone number Match Code is prefixed by 'PH~'.</p>
        <p class="Body1HeadNoTOC">Organization Address and Name Match Code</p>
        <p class="Body1">The Organization Address and Name Match Code is composed of: the zip code + metaphone3 representation of the organization’s legal name.  </p>
        <p class="Body1">The Organization Address and Name Match Code contains the prefix 'ZONM~'.</p>
