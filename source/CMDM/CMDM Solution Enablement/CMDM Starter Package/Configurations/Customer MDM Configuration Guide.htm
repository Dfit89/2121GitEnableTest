        <h1>Customer MDM Configuration Guide</h1>
        <p>The initial configurations for the enablement solution provide a generic set of configurations for a basic Customer MDM (CMDM) system for the purpose of providing quicker time to value.</p>
        <p>This document provides an in-depth overview of the CMDM initial configurations as a compliment to the CMDM Enablement Guidelines.  The target audience for this guide is any party interested in taking the initial configurations as a starting point to a new CMDM implementation.</p>
        <h2>Enablement Initial Configuration Overview</h2>
        <p>The initial configurations include basic data models, i.e., object types, attributes, references, etc., component models, workflows for clerical review of customer de-duplication, inbound integrations for data consumption, and web user interfaces (Web UI) for data stewardship.</p>
        <p>The initial configurations are largely based on the Merge Golden Record solution and addresses various implementation styles.  The implementation styles that are addressed in this guide are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Consolidation</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Coexistence</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Centralized</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"> Based on the implementation style that is most relevant to your requirements, the following configuration files may be provided:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Base Configuration</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mandatory (select one of):</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Consolidation &amp; Coexistence</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Centralized</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">SAP Data Model</li>
            <li>Optional Extension for B2B: D&amp;B Web UI Configuration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is recommended that the initial configurations are loaded into a STEP environment with the appropriate STEP Base.  STEP Base is a clean, fresh install of the STEP application.  For details on which STEP Base to take which corresponds to the purchased STEP version, please contact Stibo Systems’ Technical Services team.</p>
        <h2>STEP System Components</h2>
        <p>The following components are required to be activated in your STEP system prior to loading the initial configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Party Data Matching (partydatamatching)</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Company Data Visualization (companydata-visualization)</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">CMDM Monitoring (cmdm-monitoring)</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Profiling (profiling)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deployment of STEP components require adequate working knowledge of patching STEP environments. For deploying STEP components, it is recommended to solicit the assistance of Stibo Systems Support or Technical Services.</p>
        <h3>Third-party services</h3>
        <p>Stibo CMDM provides native integrations with third-party services to enhance the data quality and reliability of master data.  For CMDM, these third-party services include integrations with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Dun &amp; Bradstreet – For entity matching and company profiling in B2B implementations</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Loqate – For address verification</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Experian - For email validations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Should any of these third-party integrations be part of a solution, please consult with your sales representative to ensure properly licensing is procured.</p>
        <p>Installation of third-party services that require dedicated system components are not included in this guide.  Information regarding the CMDM third-party integrations is available in the STEP Online Help Documentation.  Further detailed deployment instructions may also be available upon request.</p>
        <h2>CMDM Base Configuration</h2>
        <p>The CMDM Base Configurations includes a basic data model and other configurations that are shared across the subsequent configurations.  Hence, the Base Configuration file should be loaded first.</p>
        <p>Object types and corresponding attribute definitions that are included are Organization Customer and  Contact Person.</p>
        <p>For more information on data modeling, please refer to the Data Modeling section of the Enablement Guidelines.</p>
        <h3>Data Model</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Organization Customer</p>
        <p>For B2B implementations, the initial configurations provide attributes, references, a match algorithm, and clerical review workflow for Organization Customer entity type.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Contact Persons</p>
        <p>Contact Person are also relevant for B2B implementations.  From an attribution standpoint, Contact Person is similar to Individual Customer with the exception being that a Contact Person has its own algorithm and clerical review workflow.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Address Standardization</p>
        <p>Included with the Base configuration is the Address Standardization business rule using the Loqate integration.  As noted previously, please consult Loqate documentation for details on configuring and setting up the integration.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup Tables</p>
        <p>Lookup tables may be used to compliment the match algorithms. A Word Alias Table is included for organizations Organization (Word Alias Table). An Unmatched Word Factor Table is also included for organizations (Organization Unmatched Word Factor Table).</p>
        <h2>CMDM Consolidated &amp; Coexistence Configuration</h2>
        <p>The characteristics of the Consolidated and Coexistence styles are rather similar, hence, only a single configuration file is required for either implementation style.  However, one major difference between the two styles are with regards to the synchronization of master data back to external systems.  Data synchronization requirements must be carefully vetted and designed for during the CMDM implementation.</p>
        <h3>Data Model</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Individual Customer</p>
        <p>For B2C implementations, the initial configurations provide a match algorithm and clerical review workflow for Individual Customer entity type.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Household</p>
        <p>The Household entity type is relevant to the Individual Customer use case for B2C implementations.  The initial configurations provide a match algorithm and clerical review workflow for Household.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Workflows</p>
        <p>Four clerical review workflows are provided with this configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Individual Customer Clerical Review</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Organization Customer Clerical Review</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Contact Person Clerical Review</li>
            <li class="Bullet1">Household Clerical Review</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clerical review workflows provide the data steward with an interface to view and resolve potential duplicate findings by the respective algorithms of each object type.</p>
        <p>For more information on configuring Match Algorithms and Clerical Review Workflows, see the <b>Matching, Linking, and Merging</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Matching, Linking, and Merging/Matching, Linking, and Merging.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">User Privileges</p>
        <p>The Consolidated and Coexistence configurations provide a generic user group for Data Stewards.  No special privileges will be configured for this group, and all users will have system super user privileges.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Event processor</p>
        <p>The preconfigured event processor collects events for Individual and Organization customer records to run through their respective match algorithms</p>
        <h3>Consolidation &amp; Coexistence Web UI</h3>
        <p>A Web UI configuration is provided for the purpose of meeting the operational needs of the MDM Data Steward.  The Web UI affords the data steward the ability to carry out their daily tasks such as clerical review remediation, ad-hoc stewardship responsibilities, maintaining internal hierarchies, monitoring of data governance, and running data profiles.</p>

        <h2>CMDM Centralized Configuration for B2B</h2>
        <p>In a centralized MDM style, all customer data originates within CMDM and may be synchronized downstream / throughout the enterprise.  In such a scenario, operational oversight and data governance is of utmost importance to an organization.  The CMDM must be able to accommodate complexities of data structures as well as business processes.</p>
        <h3>Data Model</h3>
        <p>As the centralized style deals primarily with the B2B use case, companies must be able to model B2B customers as well as their respective of lines of businesses.  As such, the centralized configuration includes organization customers with line of business data containers.  These data containers contain attribution that are specific to the line of business the customer does business with.</p>
        <p>Corresponding attribution and match algorithm are also provided in the configuration.</p>
        <p>A Find Similar algorithm is also provided to support the Onboarding workflow user experience.  This allows users to determine whether the customer record they intend to onboard already exists in the system.</p>
        <h3>Workflows</h3>
        <p>As customer data origination / authorship resides within CMDM, a customer creation, or onboarding, mechanism must be present to allow all departments and personas that are part of the new customer onboarding process a means to interact with the data and even collaborate with one another.</p>
        <p>The Centralized configurations includes an <span class="bold">Onboarding Workflow</span> that is designed for contribution by the following personas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local Loqate (local-loqate)</li>
            <li>Experian Email Validation (experian)</li>
            <li>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Company Match and Profiling (dnb-integration)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The workflow allows each persona to fulfill their respective enrichment activities, while providing a means for intra-departmental collaboration.</p>
        <p>Complimentary to the Onboarding workflow, an <span class="bold">Approval workflow</span> is also in place which is owned by the MDM Specialist.  The purpose of this workflow is to accommodate ad-hoc stewardship of customer data and providing a means for the MDM Specialist to review changes and execute any business validation on the changes.</p>
        <h3>User Privileges</h3>
        <p>The Centralized configurations provide distinct system user privileges for each user persona that interfaces with customer data.  User privileges are important to governance and provides are tighter control in ensuring the right people deals with the right data.</p>
        <p>Currently, the MDM Specialist may be considered as the <i>super user</i> of the Centralized MDM and has privileges to access, edit, and approve all data in the system, whereas Sales, Finance, and Logistics do not have permission to approve customer data.</p>
        <h3>Event Processor</h3>
        <p>The preconfigured event processor collects events for Organization customer records to run against the Centralized match algorithm.</p>
        <h3>Centralized Web UI</h3>
        <p>A Web UI configuration is provided which allows direct user interface to onboard, maintain, and approve customer data as it pertains to the company’s operational processes.  In the Web UI, users from Sales, Finance, Logistics, as well as MDM Specialist are able to carry out their day to day activities.</p>
        <p>For more information on configuring a Web UI, see the <b>Creating a New Web UI</b> topic in the <b>Web User Interfaces / Web UI Getting Started</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Web User Interfaces/Web UI Getting Started/Creating a New Web UI.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Inbound Integration Endpoint</h3>
        <p class="Body1">No inbound integration endpoint will be provided with the Centralized Configuration.</p>
        <h3>Component Models</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet1">Matching</li>

        <h2>CMDM SAP Data Model Configuration</h2>
        <p>As a compliment to the Centralized Configuration, the enablement configurations include a centralized approach for modeling SAP business processes in a B2B scenario.  As many companies utilize SAP as their primary ERP solution, the goal of this configuration is to allow for a more seamless bridge between customer master data and SAP data structures.</p>
        <p>For this release, the SAP configuration will include the SAP data model and corresponding business conditions to enforce SAP data modeling constraints.</p>
        <h3>Data Model</h3>
        <p>The SAP data model configuration uses the same Organization Customer entity type as the other configuration sets.  The intent of this configuration is to be able to model complex SAP data structures in order to provide a more seamless user experience for companies that utilize SAP as their primary ERP platform.  As such, the usage of relationships from in between data structures is highly emphasized as part of this release.</p>
        <h3>Data Model Constraints</h3>
        <p>The support of complex SAP data structures denotes the supporting of data integrity complexities and maintain proper constraints between the data structures.  This configuration includes basic SAP data integrity validation rules to sure data integrity is maintained in CMDM.</p>
        <p>For more information on SAP data model constraints, it is recommended to research SAP documentation for the Sales &amp; Distribution module, as well as the relevant sections in this enablement guideline as a complimentary resource.</p>
        <h2>Extension: Dun &amp; Bradstreet WebUI Configuration</h2>
        <p>A separate Dun &amp; Bradstreet Web UI configuration is available for those who are interested in implementing the third-party integration.  The Web UI configuration provides an interface for data stewards to run D&amp;B Match to obtain the DUNS number and other relevant match information.  Furthermore, data stewards may also level the Web UI configuration to run the D&amp;B Company Profile service to obtain a more detailed overview of an organization.</p>
        <h3>Component Model</h3>
        <p>For security reasons, D&amp;B subscription credentials may not be loaded via STEPXML so users are recommended to utilize the 'Easy Set-up' feature of the D&amp;B component model within the CMDM application.  Deployment of 'Easy Set-up' will automatically create the relevant D&amp;B object types, attribution, and references in the system.</p>
        <p>For more information, see the <b>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Integration</b> in the <b>Data Exchange</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Data Integration/DnB/Dun &amp; Bradstreet Integration.htm" class="HereWithParens" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> (<span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor">here</span>)</MadCap:xref> as well as the relevant sections in this enablement guideline.</p>
        <h2>Sample Data Load Files</h2>
        <p>For the Consolidated and Coexistence and Centralized configurations, three sample data Excel files are available for each of the three customer entity types to be imported via the match and merge import configuration (i.e., Individuals, Organizations, and Contact Persons).</p>
        <p>The names of these sample data files are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SampleContacts.xlsx</li>
            <li>SampleIndividuals.xlsx</li>
            <li>SampleOrganizations.xlxs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Users should import SampleOrganizations.xlsx before importing SampleContacts.xlsx.</p>
        <p>Sample data files may be imported with the Match and Merge Importer via the Asset Importer Widgets available within the Web UI.</p>
