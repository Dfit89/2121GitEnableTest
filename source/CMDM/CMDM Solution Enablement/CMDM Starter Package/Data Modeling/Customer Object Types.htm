        <h1>Customer Object Types</h1>
        <h2>What is a Customer?</h2>
        <p class="Body1">A customer is any individual or organization that purchases from a business. That said, any individual or organization could potentially interact with a business in another capacity (e.g., as a supplier or employee). Because of this, ‘Customer’ is defined as a role an organization or an individual has in the interaction with a business.</p>
        <p class="Body1">However, businesses do not typically manage information about individuals and organizations in a shared model across vastly different business processes, like procurement (supplier) and sales (customer), for simplicity’s sake. To account for this, ‘Customer’ is used as a catch-all entity type that owns all information about individuals and organizations. For more about customer types, see details about contact persons below.</p>
        <h3>Individual Customer</h3>
        <p class="Body1">For an individual customer, the typical customer attributes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First Name</li>
            <li>Last Name</li>
            <li>Addresses</li>
            <li>Date of Birth</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Phone Numbers</li>
            <li>Fax numbers</li>
            <li>Emails</li>
            <li>Social Media IDs</li>
            <li>Loyalty Card Information</li>
            <li>Government IDs (social security, passport, driver's license)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Image1">

        </p>
        <h3>Organization Customer</h3>
        <p class="Body1">For an organizational customer, the typical customer attributes are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Legal Name of the Organization</li>
            <li>Date of Formation</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Contact Information</li>
            <li>Main Phone</li>
            <li>Fax</li>
            <li>Main Email</li>
            <li>Website URL</li>
            <li>GLN / ILN</li>
            <li>DUNS Number</li>
            <li>Tax Identification Number</li>
            <li>Risk Category</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">Organization  customers are often organized in hierarchies. See section about organization hierarchies below:</p>
        <p class="Image1">

        </p>
        <h2>What is a Household?</h2>
        <p class="Body1">A household is a collection of individuals, which is typically a family, living in the same home. Each member of the household is considered an individual customer.</p>
        <p class="Body1">The purpose of these household constructs are to help businesses target customers that share a household either as a family unit or as individual customers. This allows the company to limit extraneous mailing campaigns and aggregate buying patterns.</p>
        <p class="Body1">In the CMDM initial configuration, Households are discovered by matching and created via Link Golden Records.</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/Solution Enablement/CMDM/HouseholdImage.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body1">Accurately identifying the correct members of a household comes with natural limitations, as the definition of household is quite vague and vary from case to case.  The data available to determine if specific people are actually accurately identified as part of the same household is often rather sparse.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Address and last name are the two most common matching criteria used to determine households. For more information, see the <b>Algorithm &amp;&#160;Match Codes - Household</b> section of this documentation<MadCap:xref href="../Configurations/Algorithm &amp; Match Codes - Household.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Body1">This approach is intended for situations where accuracy must aim to be good but both false positives and false negatives can be accepted, such as with the case of analytics and mailing campaigns.</p>
        <h3>Handling Composite Records with Data Containers</h3>
        <p class="Body1">A customer record comprises multiple objects. It may have multiple addresses, emails, and phone numbers, which are all considered part of the record by users, as well as surrounding systems.</p>
        <p class="Body1">This is not to be confused with hierarchical structures of separate entities with each containing their own data flow.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Examples of separate entities may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>contact persons for organization customers</li>
            <li>store branches</li>
            <li>warehouse locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">Such records are complex structures in themselves that may even reference or be referenced by other entities.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more information, see the <b>Data Containers</b> topic in the <b>System Setup / Super User Guide</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../System Setup/Attributes/Data Containers.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Addresses</h3>
        <p class="Body1">An address comprises several attributes that define a location. STEP offers specialized functionality around addresses, such as address verification via the Address Component Model.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Modeling addresses using data containers makes it possible to manage more than one address on the same customer / contact person. Data containers simplify the data modeling by providing a reusable address definition across multiple object types. When displayed in Web UI, addresses modeled using data containers  can appear as one formatted value, despite being made of several attributes.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Addresses have metadata associated with them via the Address Component Model, the CASS address component model, and potentially solution specific meta data.</p>
        <h3>Email Addresses and Phone Numbers</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Email addresses and phone numbers should be modeled as data containers, as it is typical to have multiple phone numbers and email addresses for the same customer or contact person. It is also common to have meta data associated to each phone number or email address. The initial configurations have PhoneType as a Data container key. This allows a customer to only have one of each type of phone (cell, home, etc).</p>
        <h2>Handling Confidential Information</h2>
        <h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Credit Card information should not be stored in or pass through STEP due to compliance requirements. It is simpler to store 'Recurring Charge Subscription IDs' when integrating to third-party services.</p>
        <h3>Bank Account Information</h3>
        <p class="Body1">Handling bank account information does not typically require more security than name and address information.</p>
        <h3>Privileges</h3>
        <p class="Body1">STEP Privileges to control who has access to what attributes and/or attribute groups.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p class="Body1">This guide does not cover information security in STEP in a broader sense, like infrastructure recommendations, encryption strategies, etc.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The sample data provided in the initial configuration provides only main addresses. There are no delivery addresses.</p>
