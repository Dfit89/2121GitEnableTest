        <h1>SAP Customers and Enterprise Structure Definitions</h1>
        <p class="Body1">This documentation assumes an understanding of generic SAP structures. The following diagram shows an example of the data structure within SAP in a CMDM implementation.</p>

        <p>This topic uses a number of SAP terminology.  All readers are recommended to be familiar with this terminology to better understand SAP data structures.</p>
        <p>For the following terms, please refer to this SAP Online Documentation for further details:</p>

        <h2>Relations and Constraints</h2>
        <p>The following sections are expansions on the logical data model which details the relationships between entities and elements that include SAP customer and enterprise structures.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Uniqueness Constraints</p>
        <p>The following is a summary of the uniqueness constraints presented in the Logical Model diagram:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The following types are unique by ID:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">CompanyCode</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">SalesOrganization</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">DistributionChannel</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Division</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Customer</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>SalesArea is unique by the combination of SalesOrganization, DistributionChannel and Division</li>
            <li>CustomerSalesAreaData is unique by Customer and SalesArea</li>
            <li>CustomerCompanyCodeData is unique by Customer and CompanyCode</li>
        </ul>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Area Constraints</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/SystemSetup/SalesAreaConstraint.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>‘SAP Customer Sales area data,’ a data container, is valid for a customer only if the sales area is currently associated to a sales organization that is, in turn, also associated with the same company code for which that the customer has data.</p>
        <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print" />
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Partner Functions Constraints</p>
        <p class="Image1">
            <img src="../../../../../../Resources/Images/SystemSetup/PartnerFunctionConstraints.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>A Customer has one, and only one, account group. An account group has one-to-many valid partner functions.  Not all customers can act in all partner functions.</p>
        <p>Each customer has exactly one account group and, by extension, must also have one or multiple partner function relations.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Common Distribution Channel and Division Constraints</p>
        <p>To avoid redundant sales area master data across distribution channels and divisions, distribution channels and division may have a common 'parent,' which is logically resolved into what may be termed as 'common sales areas.'  This concept means that sales areas associated to a particular distribution channel and division may not also be the 'parent' of a different distribution channel and division that is already associated with another sales area.  This hierarchy is nested.</p>
        <p>If a customer is active in a sales area that is common for other sales areas, this customer cannot have master data in these other sales areas.</p>
