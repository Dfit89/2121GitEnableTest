        <p class="Body1">When considering a centralized approach to addressing Business-to-Business (B2B) Customer MDM, the following domains and industries are applicable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 

Customer MDM domain for: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">
Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry 

</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Distribution and Manufacturing industry </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>

Supplier MDM domain for: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">

Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">

Distribution and Manufacturing industry </li>
            <li class="Bullet2">

Retail industry 
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">
The complexity of the customer master data has three elements:  

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complexity within the customers’ organization 
</li>
            <li>
Complexity within the CPG company’s internal organization – in SAP called the 'Enterprise Structure' </li>
            <li>

MDM must couple the customer's complex organization with the CPG company’s complex internal organization </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1"> 

SAP has a structure that is closely aligned with the reality of these organizations and SAP is also likely the ERP of most of these companies. Therefore, SAP is an important and very useful reference point for understanding these organizations and processes and well as for understanding what surrounding systems we must be able to coexist with. 

</p>
        <p class="Body1">The MDM platform must be able to accommodate the complexities of SAP data structures and processes with basic capabilities for data modeling, user privileges, processes, integrations, and usability. 

</p>
        <h2>Background </h2>
        <p class="Body1">Many companies, e.g., in the CPG industry, manage a wide array of products, brands, categories, and channels, and serve diverse customer segments across multiple countries worldwide. 

</p>
        <p class="Body1">The end consumers of products are either individual consumers or businesses like hospitals, schools, restaurants, etc. </p>
        <p class="Body1">

For CPG companies, the majority of revenue is generated by selling through a network of retail chains, distributors and master wholesalers. These parties are who the CPG company considers its customers.</p>
        <p class="Body1">

Any CPG company has the following functions as part of the sales side of their business</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

Sales (including e.g., Promotion Planning) 
</li>
            <li>Distribution 

</li>
            <li>Accounting and finance</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">

It is common for each of these functions to be managed locally in each country and, to some extent, in each line of business. This is, in many cases, a reasonable decentralization of the organization, because of a need for regional agility in combination with relatively small optimization gain a centralized organization could have. 

</p>
        <p class="Body1">An example of this is CleanGoods Manufacturer, a fictitious CPG company, which specializes in cleaning products and operates across two major business units: 

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional household cleaning products. In this case the end consumer will buy the products in a retail store 

</li>
            <li>Clinical products for professionals. In this case the end consumer will be hospitals, doctors, physicians, etc. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">Business units may sell different and/or the same products and these products are sold and distributed differently via various sales organizations and distribution channels. The same customer may buy products from different product lines.</p>
        <p class="Body1">

CleanGoods Manufacturer operates in many countries. Even though CleanGoods deals with international as well as local companies, it is common for customers to have separate business units in each country. </p>
