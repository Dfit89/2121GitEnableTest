        <h1>Data Modeling</h1>
        <p class="Body1">With the help of this guide, users should be able to model the following common customer data challenges in STEP:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual and Organization Customers</li>
            <li>Individuals as Contact Persons</li>
            <li>Contact Persons in relation to Organization Customers</li>
            <li>Addresses and Contact Information specific to a Customers and Contact Persons</li>
        </ul>
