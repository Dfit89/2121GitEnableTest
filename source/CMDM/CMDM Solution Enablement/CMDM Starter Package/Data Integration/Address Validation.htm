        <h1>Address Validation</h1>
        <p class="Body1">Loqate validations can occur at three different points when dealing with customer records:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">During Import of Source Records</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">After surviving attribute values have been determined for a newly created Golden Record</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">When updating existing Golden Records</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">It is recommended to validate address values upon Import and after Survivorship.</p>
        <p class="Body1">For more general information on&#160;Loqate, see the <b>Loqate Integration</b> section of the <b>Data Integration</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../../../../../Data Integration/Loqate/Loqate Integration.htm" class="Here"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Validate on Import</h2>
        <p class="Body1">By calling Loqate during Import, each Source Record will have its address values standardized before matching takes place. Raw values taken from Source Systems commonly include typos or inconsistent formatting. By standardizing these values beforehand, the matching algorithm is able to match records more accurately.</p>
        <h2>Validate on&#160;Survivorship</h2>
        <p class="Body1">Validating addresses after survivorship ensures that the surviving address values are standardized. However, because address matching is less reliable when matching raw values taken from Source Systems, it is recommended to validate on Import as well. </p>
        <h2>Validate Updates to Existing Records</h2>
        <p class="Body1">A Data Steward can trigger Loqate for single records or when running a bulk update for a collection. By using either of the maintenance methods listed below, address values can be standardized when records are updated.</p>
        <p class="Body1">Maintenance Validation Methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet2">A 'Run Business Rule' button on a Node Details screen</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">Running a Bulk Update configuration (an Address Validation business rule can be configured for bulk updates)</li>
            <li class="Bullet2">An Event processor can monitor for changes to the address inputs. When changes are detected, an event is generated to have Loqate re-standardize the updated address.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body1">By using Bulk Update, existing records can have their address values standardized whenever their data is updated. </p>
        <h2>Validate via Webservice Request</h2>
        <p>Address standardization can be triggered from an external system which will generate a request and receive a response containing the standardized address information. This requires no direct interaction with STEP and provides a better user experience in allowing external systems to use Loqate's address standardization feature.  In exposing address validation to external applications, address data points may be standardized prior to flowing into CMDM, which further ensures that data is trusted and verified.</p>
        <p>For an example use case for using address validation via webservice request,  refer to the <b>Scenario 2 - E-commerce</b> section of the <b>Business-to-Customer Coexistence Use Case</b> topic in the <b>CMDM Data Flow</b> documentation<MadCap:xref href="../Data Flow/Business-to-Customer Coexistence Use Case.htm" class="Here" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Web"><span style="color: Blue;" class="mcFormatColor"> here</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="note1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">All customers that have purchased a Loqate license, either cloud or local, will have access to this service.</p>
