        <ul>
            <li>Email is the primary means of communication.</li>
            <li>Maintaining brand awareness among existing and prospective customers.</li>
            <li>Ensures marketing campaigns adequately and efficiently reaches target audiences.</li>
            <li>Protects your brand reputation.</li>
            <li>Maintain good standing status with email providers by reducing the amount of bounce-backs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stibo Systems' CMDM offers an integration with Experian Clean Web Service to validate emails in bulk for customers, contacts, and prospects.</p>
        <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>Pearl is a data steward who works closely with the marketing department to build seasonal campaigns and corresponding collateral. Today, the use of digital marketing platform to drive sales, increase brand awareness, and promote customer loyalty is widespread.  This implies that for marketing strategies to succeed, having the proper contact information for customers and prospective customers is paramount.</p>
        <p> ACME’s marketing department relies on email contacts provided by existing customers within loyalty programs as well as other marketing initiatives.  To assist with ensuring success of the campaign, Pearl is tasked with making sure that email addresses are valid within the customer master (CMDM).  By having an analysis of the accuracy of email addresses, ACME may then determine the cause of any discrepancies with the existing workflow of gathering email contacts.</p>
        <p> In leveraging CMDM’s email validation solution using Experian, Pearl is able to validate email addresses in bulk.  Validated email data may then be synchronized with the marketing team’s CRM application.  Having validated their email contacts, Pearl can now search for and identify the various reasons email address may be bad or unreachable.
